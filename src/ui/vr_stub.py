"""
EdenQuest VR Stub for Unreal Engine 5 Integration

This scaffold defines symbolic mappings and immersive feedback logic
for developers implementing Eden Protocol in a 3D/VR Unreal Engine environment.

Gameplay logic, aura effects, bHaptics integration, and ElevenLabs narration
are described in structured comments and symbolic pseudocode.
"""

# AVATAR RENDERING SYSTEM
# ------------------------
# - Map primary/secondary aura colors to dynamic shaders
# - Render aura intensity based on EQ (emotional regulation) value
# - Apply animated aura flicker if trait imbalances occur
# - Alter body posture or idle animations based on MBTI archetype

# EXAMPLE:
# if avatar.archetype == "Builder":
#     play_animation("builder_idle")
# if tree["resilience"] < 40:
#     apply_aura_shader("flickering")


# TREE OF LIFE HUD
# ----------------
# - Visual overlay or floating tree branching system
# - Dynamic leaf color, bloom, or decay based on trait values
# - Root system pulses when user performs physical actions correctly

# EXAMPLE:
# update_branch_color("discipline", green if tree["discipline"] > 70 else brown)
# pulse_root("resilience") when movement_tracker.detects_balance()


# SYMBOLIC DUNGEON TRIGGERS
# -------------------------
# - Quest themes manifest as procedurally generated VR instances
# - Triggered by low or high symbolic traits
# - Include puzzle, shadow work, and transformation chambers

# EXAMPLE:
# if tree["mindfulness"] < 30:
#     load_dungeon("Hall of Mirrors")
# if quest.target_branch == "resilience":
#     use_environment("Storm Cavern")


# ELEVENLABS VOICE INTEGRATION
# ----------------------------
# - AI narrator speaks user-specific guidance and moral challenges
# - Tone, pace, and emotional content adjust to Tree of Life shifts

# EXAMPLE:
# narrator.speak("You’re slipping again... breathe, and begin.")
# if tree["discipline"] rises above threshold:
#     narrator.speak("The storm breaks for those who stay the course.")


# B-HAPTICS IMMERSION
# -------------------
# - Trigger haptic feedback based on emotional breakthroughs
# - Simulate aura surges, symbolic wounds, and realignment

# EXAMPLE:
# if quest.completed and tree["emotional_regulation"] rises:
#     trigger_haptics("chest_bloom")
# if user enters shadow dungeon:
#     trigger_haptics("torso_tremble")


# NPC INTERACTION LOGIC
# ---------------------
# - Symbolic characters reflect Jungian archetypes (Shadow, Anima, Sage)
# - Response trees evolve based on user truth (XP integrity, aura decay)

# EXAMPLE:
# if user lies or bypasses quests:
#     NPCs speak in riddles or refuse aid
# if XP integrity high:
#     unlock NPC guidance path or reward glyphs


# ENVIRONMENTAL EVOLUTION
# ------------------------
# - Tree of Life growth affects world lighting, music, and color palette
# - World Tree appears more visible and radiant with high collective Eden Vitality

# EXAMPLE:
# if eden_vitality_index > 85:
#     bloom_world_tree(), lighten_sky()
# if user breaks symbolic vow:
#     trigger_world_decay_animation()


# FINAL NOTE:
# This stub will serve as a blueprint for translating symbolic architecture into
# immersive VR experience. Unreal Engine devs will use these mappings to define:
# - Game states
# - Trigger volumes
# - Audio cues
# - Cinematic transitions
# - Quest gates and dungeon generators

# No executable code needed—this is mythic-engineering logic-to-reality translation.
# Hand off this file as documentation for a future VR team or Epic MegaGrant application.
