## 🏛️ Advancement Philosophy
Eden is not a meritocracy of speed or volume. XP is gained slowly, soulbound to truth, and earned through verifiable presence.

To rise through the ranks:
- Contribute rituals that align with the Tree of Life
- Participate in symbolic governance
- Mentor others and maintain truth in all layers of creation
