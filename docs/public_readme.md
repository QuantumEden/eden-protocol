# 🌱 Eden Protocol

A modular symbolic framework for **trauma recovery**, **identity transformation**, and **post-capitalist governance** — designed as a sacred, zero-surveillance operating system.

## ✨ What Is Eden?

**Eden is not a game.  
Eden is not a diagnosis tool.  
Eden is not a product.**

**Eden is a ritual operating system.**

Built for those who refuse to heal by force, Eden mirrors your growth — not your metrics.  
It speaks in archetypes, remembers through soulbound tokens, and evolves through voluntary truth.

## 🧱 Core Systems

### 🧠 Psychometric Avatar Engine
- MBTI-type mapped to symbolic archetypes (Strategist, Healer, Builder, Guardian)
- Visual aura, glyph, and trait mapping from IQ, EQ, and moral foundation
- Soulform unlocks after transformative trials — not purchase

### 🌳 Tree of Life Trait Network
- Six core branches: `discipline`, `resilience`, `mindfulness`, `expression`, `physical_care`, `emotional_regulation`
- Trait growth is earned through real-world rituals and reflection
- Decay occurs when alignment is broken (e.g., relapse, denial, avoidance)

### 🪙 MeritCoin XP Economy
- Zero-fi, non-tradable, soulbound proof-of-growth system
- XP awarded only when transformation is verified by symbolic conditions
- Merit unlocks:
  - Soulform transformations
  - Realignment quests
  - DAO privileges
  - Shadow path revelations

### 🎮 EdenQuest Engine
- Procedurally generated quests using AI + narrative schema
- Voice roles (Mentor, Echo, Inner Voice) guide the ritual
- Missions triggered by user profile, disclosure, or stagnation
- Includes mythic dungeons, realignment trials, and soulform rites

### 🗳️ DAO Governance Layer
- Truth-weighted voting tied to MeritCoin level
- Public proposal registry (open_registry.md)
- Encrypted trauma tokens enable symbolic policy input
- zkXP proofs (zero-knowledge XP commitments) protect privacy
