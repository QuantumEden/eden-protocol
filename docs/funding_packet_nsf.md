# NSF Grant Proposal – Eden Protocol (MVP + Phase 2 Development)

## 🧬 Project Title:
**Eden Protocol: A Symbolic AI System for Trauma-Informed, Immersive Healing**

---

## 🔹 Executive Summary

Eden Protocol is an AI-supported symbolic healing system that transforms behavioral therapy into a self-guided, immersive process rooted in metaphor, identity, and ritual design. Built by a U.S. military veteran, Eden offers a non-clinical, non-invasive therapeutic architecture for individuals navigating trauma, burnout, or moral injury — with a special emphasis on veterans.

It is not a diagnostic tool.  
It does not track.  
It does not gamify.

Instead, it provides an environment where growth is visible, alignment is rewarded, and voluntary self-reflection becomes the path to psychological integration.

This grant proposal seeks support from the National Science Foundation to:

- Finalize Eden’s mobile and web-based MVP (Phase 1)  
- Launch a veteran-centered pilot cohort  
- Expand core modules into immersive and biometric experiences (Phase 2)  
- Deploy an ethical DAO governance framework for symbolic modding, peer rituals, and secure growth verification

---

## 🔹 Core Problem

Veterans and trauma survivors often disengage from traditional care due to:

- Invasive surveillance or tracking  
- Over-reliance on pharmaceuticals  
- Stigma or diagnostic pressure  
- Bureaucratic and depersonalized systems

There is a growing population seeking **sovereign**, **narrative-driven**, **symbolically meaningful** healing environments — where they are not analyzed, but invited.

---

## 🔹 Eden Protocol as a Solution

Eden provides a psychologically credible alternative. Core features include:

- Daily “EdenQuests” generated via GPT-powered symbolic prompts  
- Personality-driven avatars with aura, glyph, and moral alignment traits  
- A visual Tree of Life that grows based on user effort, ritual reflection, and moral action  
- An opt-in encrypted trauma disclosure vault (no exposure, no analytics)  
- A DAO-powered merit system based on integrity, not engagement

Eden uses symbolic architecture to bypass resistance. It heals through design, not prescription.

---

## 🔹 AI and Technology Context

Eden leverages modern AI tools in a controlled, ethical framework:

- **GPT-based prompt engineering** for personalized therapeutic quests  
- **ElevenLabs voice synthesis** to guide users with internal narrative roles  
- **Zero-Knowledge XP commits** to allow transformation without surveillance  
- **Soulbound avatars** that evolve based on symbolic progress, not cosmetic preference  
- **Truth-weighted DAO voting** for communal governance without speculation

All data is local, encrypted, and user-owned. Eden is designed to never extract.

## 🔹 Target Populations

- U.S. veterans seeking non-clinical recovery paths  
- Survivors of trauma or moral injury  
- Neurodivergent users or late-stage burnout professionals  
- Nonreligious users seeking **ritual without dogma**  
- Researchers in symbolic cognition, therapeutic AI, or decentralized ethics
