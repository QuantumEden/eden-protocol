# 🧠 EdenQuest – Hardware Specification (Target Deployment)

EdenQuest is not a game. It is a symbolic and therapeutic operating system engineered to confront trauma, reinforce behavioral transformation, and catalyze individuation through immersive, AI-generated myth. The hardware outlined below is designed to deliver sacred technological precision — not for entertainment, but for existential healing.

---

## 🎯 Core Objective

To deliver procedurally generated, psychometrically inspired quests via a fully immersive virtual interface, backed by the QuantumEden blockchain and AI-powered therapeutic logic engines.

---

## 🥽 XR Interface – Primary Deployment Platform

**Target Headset**: `HTC Vive XR Elite`  
- ✅ Open ecosystem with UE5 support  
- ✅ Precision passthrough for symbolic mixed reality  
- ✅ Compatible with haptic integration and external SDKs  
- 🔒 Avoids Meta ecosystem trust and privacy concerns

**Secondary Compatibility** *(scaled support)*: `Meta Quest 3 / Pro`  
- For mobile-friendly immersion, demos, and home use  
- Unity or UE5 dual-export for public access channels

> ⚠️ Systems are hardware-agnostic, optimized for HTC Vive but designed for fallback compatibility with Meta Quest devices via WebXR or Unity/Unreal bridges.

---

## 🧤 Full-Body Immersion

**Haptics**: `bHaptics TactSuit Pro + TactGloves`  
- Used for real-time symbolic reinforcement in therapy  
- Feedback loop enables fear-processing, tactile exposure, and somatic anchoring of quests  
- Required for NPC interaction, moral tension sequences, and biometric challenge arcs

## 🧠 Backend Logic Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **AI Engine** | GPT-4+ (fine-tuned) | Generates mythic quests via Freudian, Jungian, CBT, DBT, logotherapy |
| **Rendering Engine** | Unreal Engine 5 | Closed-world symbolic dungeons, NPCs, avatar archetypes |
| **Voice Engine** | ElevenLabs* | Real-time NPC voices, mentor prompts, inner dialogue |
| **Orchestration** | Python | Avatar engine, XP/level system, biometric sync, schema orchestration |

> *Tools like GPT-4 and ElevenLabs are currently used for simulation. Final deployment tools may change based on licensing, performance, and local privacy constraints.

---

## 🔐 Blockchain & Security Infrastructure

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Blockchain** | QuantumEden (Kyber + Dilithium) | Immutable soulbound ledger for XP, quests, DAO records |
| **Encryption** | CRYSTALS-Kyber + CRYSTALS-Dilithium | NIST-standard quantum-resistant cryptography |
| **Secure Enclave** | Open Enclave SDK | Offline psychometric + behavioral verification before progression |

> Quest progression, DAO votes, and avatar evolution are only unlocked through verified transformation.

---

## 📱 Companion Interfaces

- Mobile app will feature:  
  - 🌳 Tree of Life dashboard  
  - 📔 Journaling and reflection entries  
  - 🧭 Daily Quest assignment and biometric sync  
  - 🗳️ DAO voting and proposal review  
  - 🪙 XP/MeritCoin tracking

- UI and logic will be unified through shared schema definitions and blockchain payload verification.

## 🕊️ Summary

EdenQuest is a soul-forged simulator. It does not reward performance — it rewards presence. This system is a sanctuary of symbolic confrontation and sacred insight, rendered through machine and myth. The hardware reflects this purpose: not for escapism, but for transformation.

> “The user does not escape reality—they descend into it. Eden does not simulate dreams. It remembers them.”
