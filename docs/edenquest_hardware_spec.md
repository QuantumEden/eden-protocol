# EdenQuest Hardware Specification

EdenQuest is not a game. It is a high-fidelity symbolic and therapeutic operating system designed to confront psychological trauma, reinforce behavioral transformation, and catalyze spiritual individuation through immersive, AI-generated myth. The infrastructure required to operate EdenQuest reflects this mission in both power and purpose.

## Required Hardware Configuration

### VR/XR Interface
- **Headset**: HTC Vive XR Elite
  - Reason: High-fidelity mixed reality for both introspective dungeon spaces and social simulations

### Full-Body Immersion
- **Haptics**: bHaptics TactSuit Pro + TactGloves
  - Reason: Real-time feedback loop for exposure therapy, fear processing, tactile symbolism, and emotion-linked quests

### Personal Computer (PC)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 4080 or 4090
  - Reason: Real-time Unreal Engine 5 rendering, AI simulation, multi-threaded visual generation
- **CPU**: Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 9 7900X/7950X
  - Reason: Multi-core processing of AI quests, user behavior analysis, and blockchain interaction
- **Memory**: 32 GB RAM minimum
- **Storage**: 2 TB SSD (minimum)
- **Cooling Infrastructure**: Required for sustained load during symbolic rendering and real-time AI logic

## Backend Infrastructure

### AI & Engine Layer
- **LLM Engine**: ChatGPT-4+ (fine-tuned)
  - Purpose: Psychoanalytical quest generation using Freudian, Jungian, CBT, DBT, and logotherapeutic frameworks
- **Rendering Engine**: Unreal Engine 5
  - Purpose: Closed-world, modular instance generation for symbolic environments, NPCs, and avatar evolution
- **Voice Engine**: ElevenLabs
  - Purpose: Emotional NPCs, mentor voices, antagonist projection, and inner monologue processing
- **Orchestration**: Python
  - Purpose: Core glue code, system controller for avatar state, tree integrity, leveling system, and external inputs

---

## Data & Security Layer
- **Blockchain**: QuantumEden (KYBER-encrypted)
  - Architecture: CRYSTALS-Kyber + Dilithium, quantum-resistant encryption standards
  - Purpose: Immutable, cryptographically validated behavioral ledger for XP, avatars, and DAO governance

- **Secure Enclave Integration**:
  - Offline validation of user integrity (psychometrics, biometric, behavioral consistency)
  - Verifies transformation is real before unlocking new quests or MeritCoin progression

## Summary
EdenQuest is a soul-forged simulator. It does not reward performance. It rewards presence. The hardware requirements exist not for graphical novelty—but because trauma, honesty, and individuation deserve a sacred interface. This system is a temple built from machine and myth.

> “The user does not escape reality—they descend into it. Eden does not simulate dreams. It remembers them.”
