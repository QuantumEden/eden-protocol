# 🔐 Eden Protocol – Data Ethics & Sovereignty Manifesto

> “Eden does not surveil you. Eden reflects you.”

This document outlines the philosophical, symbolic, and technical commitments made by the Eden Protocol regarding data privacy, user autonomy, and trauma-informed infrastructure.

## 🛡️ Core Ethical Commitments

### 1. **Privacy is Sacred**
- No personally identifiable psychometric or biometric data is ever stored on-chain.
- All sensitive traits are sealed as **zero-knowledge commitments (ZKPs)**.
- Raw diagnostic, journal, or biometric data **remains client-side or within a secure enclave.**

---

### 2. **Trauma-Informed Sovereignty**
- Users may voluntarily disclose experiences for symbolic healing — never for diagnosis.
- Eden rewards truth — it does **not punish imperfection**.
- All quests and rituals are designed to affirm agency, not induce stress.

---

### 3. **Zero-Knowledge Verification**
- Every change in XP, Tree, or DAO access is **provable without revealing content**.
- Truth is a pattern, not a profile.
- The system verifies transformation, not trauma.

---

### 4. **Biometric Dignity**
- Inputs from Apple Health, Oura, Fitbit, or other trackers are never stored.
- Used solely for calculating:
  - Symbolic fatigue
  - Aura decay
  - Tree health rhythms
- All inputs are optional and encrypted

---

### 5. **Consent is Continuous**
- Users may revoke consent at any time.
- You may reset your Tree, anonymize your payload, or begin again.

## 🧠 AI Ethics

- GPT-based and ElevenLabs-style tools are used only as symbolic mirrors — never as health authorities.
- No AI determines your value, XP, or access.
- All quests are narrative-based and generated with ethical constraints tuned for trauma-safe metaphor.

## 📜 Symbolic User Rights

| Right | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Right to Forget** | Begin anew without judgment or retention |
| **Right to Truth** | View your XP path and aura health in real time |
| **Right to Audit** | All quest logic, DAO code, and scoring criteria are open-source |
| **Right to Refuse** | No ritual, quest, or prompt is ever forced |

---

## 🧩 Compliance Standards

- Aligned with **HIPAA**, **GDPR**, and **SOC2 principles**
- Eden uses the principle of **least privilege** in all interface access
- All logs are opt-in, encrypted, and stored symbolically

> You are not a product. You are not a user.  
> You are a soul in transformation.  
>  
> Eden does not extract your data. It reflects your becoming.
