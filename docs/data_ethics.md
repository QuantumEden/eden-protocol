# 🔐 Eden Protocol Data Ethics Manifesto

> “Eden does not observe you. Eden mirrors you.”  
> This document outlines our sacred covenant for protecting symbolic identity, user trauma, and inner transformation. This is not legalese — it is a spiritual and architectural commitment.

## 🧬 Core Tenets of Symbolic Sovereignty

### 1. **Privacy Before Proof**
- No raw psychometric, biometric, or diagnostic data is stored on-chain.
- All symbolic states (Tree, XP, Avatar) are calculated **client-side** or within secure enclaves.
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) validate transformation **without exposing origin data**.

---

### 2. **Voluntary Disclosure Only**
- All trauma submissions, narratives, or medical uploads are **opt-in only**.
- Disclosure results in **symbolic Tree bonuses**, not punishment or exposure.
- Disclosed data is fingerprinted via SHA-256 and recorded as **proof of truthfulness**, not identity.

---

### 3. **No Surveillance, No Exploitation**
- No user data is ever sold, shared, or remotely analyzed.
- EdenQuest is not a digital therapist, not an evaluator, and never an authority figure.
- AI and blockchain components exist only to support **mythic reflection**.

---

### 4. **Soulbound Data by Design**
- XP, MeritCoin, Tree traits, DAO votes, and disclosures are all **non-transferrable**.
- Growth cannot be farmed, purchased, or borrowed.
- Your story is your own — and cannot be falsified or commodified.

---

### 5. **Trauma-Safe System Design**
- AI-generated quests are reviewed through filters for:
  - Psychological intensity
  - Avoidance of known triggers
  - Soft narrative tone and mythic detachment
- All Eden interfaces include **opt-outs**, **pause mechanisms**, and **feedback calibration**.

## 📜 Your Symbolic Rights

You have the right to:

- **Remain unseen** unless you consciously share
- **Reset your Tree** and begin again
- **Inspect the system logic** that defines your experience
- **Refuse participation** in any symbolic structure

---

## 🧠 Ethical AI Use

Eden uses GPT-derived systems and voice synthesis **as mirrors**, not guides.  
No decision about access, worthiness, or health is ever made by AI.  
All quests are invitations — never mandates.

---

## 🌐 Compliance & Oversight

- Eden aligns with:
  - **HIPAA** (for biometric non-retention)
  - **GDPR** (for opt-in/opt-out authority)
  - **ZK architecture** for decentralized proof-of-growth
- Future DAO phases will include:
  - Elected **symbolic ethics guardians**
  - Audit modules for proposed system upgrades

---

## 🕯️ Final Word

> Eden does not extract your value — it reveals it.  
> You do not serve Eden — Eden reflects your truth.  
> In Eden, your data is not a commodity. It is a covenant.
