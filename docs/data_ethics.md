# 🔐 Eden Protocol Data Ethics & Sovereignty Manifesto

> “Eden does not surveil you. Eden reflects you.”

This document outlines the guiding ethical principles and security standards that govern all data within the Eden Protocol, with an emphasis on privacy, trauma-informed design, and user sovereignty. This is not a legal agreement — it is a philosophical and architectural pledge.

## 🔒 Core Principles

### 1. **Privacy First**
- No personally identifiable psychometric or biometric data is stored on-chain.
- All identity traits are reduced to **zero-knowledge commitments (ZKPs)**.
- All psychometric data remains client-side or within a secure enclave.

### 2. **Zero-Knowledge Verification (ZK)**
- User actions (XP, quests, DAO votes) are **verified without exposing source data**.
- All transformation is **provable but not surveilled**.
- Truth is a pattern — not a dossier.

### 3. **Biometric Sovereignty**
- Users retain full control over all physical input data (e.g. from Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura).
- Eden only accesses biometric information to calculate Tree of Life health indicators and symbolic decay.
- No biometric information is ever sold, exported, or analyzed outside the symbolic system.

### 4. **Trauma-Safe Design**
- The system avoids triggering content, uses soft symbolic language, and offers opt-outs from difficult sequences.
- AI-generated quests are constrained by ethical guardrails that **prioritize emotional safety** over narrative intensity.
- bHaptics and voice systems include emergency calibration to prevent overstimulation or flashback conditions.

### 5. **Soulbound Records**
- All MeritCoin, XP, and DAO contributions are **soulbound** — they cannot be traded, sold, or manipulated.
- Your growth is yours alone. Your story cannot be faked, borrowed, or erased.

## 🧠 Ethical AI Use

- The Eden Protocol uses GPT-based and ElevenLabs systems **strictly as symbolic tools**.
- No AI is granted autonomous decision-making over a user's health, worth, or access.
- AI-generated quests are reflective mirrors — not prescriptive mandates.

## ⚖️ User Bill of Rights (Symbolic)

1. **Right to remain private** – Your shadow is not our concern unless you choose to reveal it.
2. **Right to forget** – You may reset your Tree, anonymize your history, and begin again.
3. **Right to audit** – All logic governing your XP, avatar state, and DAO role is open-source.
4. **Right to non-compliance** – You are never forced to participate. Eden is not punishment. Eden is presence.

## 📜 Compliance and Future Expansion

- Eden aligns with GDPR, HIPAA, and the principle of **least privilege**.
- Future versions will include: encrypted local vaults, homomorphic processing for biometric input, and community-elected ethics guardians within the DAO.

> In Eden, your data is not a commodity — it is a covenant.
