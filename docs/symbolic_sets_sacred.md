## 🎭 Usage Rules

- Sacred path sets are **not cosmetic** — they determine aura tint, quest framing, and DAO ritual access.
- Colors are rendered in avatar ring, quest aura overlays, and Tree of Life blossoms.
- Glyphs are non-textual metaphors and used only in symbolic UI, never exposed publicly unless permitted.
