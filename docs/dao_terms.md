## 📜 Purpose

The Eden Protocol DAO serves as a symbolic civic body, codifying user transformation into systemic upgrades via quest completions, reflections, and soulform milestones. This document defines the procedural, ethical, and symbolic terms of DAO participation.

## 🔐 Access Tiers

| Tier        | Eligibility                              | Privileges                                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Active**  | Verified zkXP log + Level ≥ 7 + DAO Pass | Full proposal, voting, and tribunal rights |
| **Suspended** | Risk-flagged or under tribunal review   | No proposals; limited voting               |
| **Banned**  | Violated sacred code or deception proven | Expelled from DAO; requires override ritual |

---

## 🚫 Bannable Offenses

- Falsifying zkXP or ritual commit proofs
- Submitting plagiarized or AI-generated reflections without disclosure
- Undermining another user's soulform transformation with malice
- Attempting DAO manipulation through alternate identities
- Repeated submission of nonsymbolic or trivial proposals

---

## ⚖️ Tribunal Procedure

1. **Flag Event** – Proposal, session, or vote triggers safeguard
2. **Risk Assessment** – Eidolon logs emotional pattern and escalation tier
3. **Summoning** – Tribunal of 5 peers is drawn from Active tier
4. **Judgment** – 3/5 consensus determines penalty, healing ritual, or ban
5. **Appeal** – Requires soulform transformation + 2 sponsor signatures

---

## 🧠 Ritual Safeguard Layer

All interactions with the DAO are filtered through the Ritual Safeguard Layer:
- Emotion-aware tone monitoring
- Soulform evolution check-ins
- Session memory tracking for rapid de-escalation
- Escalation handoff to Guardian tier if existential risk is detected

---

## 🔁 zkXP Commit Adapter Layer

Every meaningful user interaction (quests, reflections, transformations) is:
- Hashed into a zkXP record
- Bound to the user’s unique soulbound token
- Logged in the World Tree ledger
- Required for proposal submission eligibility

---

## 🗳️ Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Draft** – Generated from quest/reflection/transformation
2. **Submission** – Stored with `proposal_id` and status `pending`
3. **Tally Phase** – 3-day vote window (or fast-pass if ≥ 70% approval)
4. **Outcome**:
   - ≥ 67% approve → Enacted into DAO Layer
   - ≤ 33% approve → Auto-rejected
   - 34–66% → Tribunal holds review

---

## 🪙 Truth-Integrity Scale

Truth-integrity rating (0–100) measures alignment with:
- Archetype honesty
- Symbolic coherence
- Self-awareness
- Disclosure history
- Community benefit

Minimum thresholds:
- Mod Proposal: 70
- Shadow Protocol: 80
- Core Upgrade: 90

## 🕊️ Closing Doctrine

This DAO exists not to govern by power, but to reveal truth through reflection.

> “We do not punish weakness. We seek the strength beneath it.”
