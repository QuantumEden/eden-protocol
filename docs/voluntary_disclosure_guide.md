# 🛡️ EdenQuest Voluntary Disclosure Guide

In EdenQuest, truth is not extracted — it is offered. This guide explains how you can choose to share your experiences to enhance your journey and receive symbolic recognition through XP, quests, and Tree growth.

## 💬 Why Would I Disclose Anything?

EdenQuest rewards *presence*, not performance. When you choose to share your struggles, the system:

- Issues **symbolic XP** for transparency
- Adjusts your **Tree of Life** to better match your internal state
- Unlocks **therapeutic questlines** rooted in your real experience
- Protects your story through encryption — never shared, never mined

---

## 🔐 What Do You Share?

You can submit any combination of the following:
- 🧠 Diagnoses (e.g., PTSD, Depression, TBI)
- 🩸 Tags (e.g., combat, assault, betrayal, insomnia)
- 📘 Your story (optional symbolic narrative)
- 📎 Attached files (e.g., PDFs, medical summaries)

You are never required to share. XP and healing can still happen.  
But truth is a powerful accelerant.

## 🔏 What Happens Next?

Once submitted:
1. ✅ Your disclosure is **validated against a schema**
2. 🔐 It is **encrypted** and hashed into your user record
3. 🌳 Your Tree of Life recalibrates symbolically
4. 🎖️ You gain symbolic XP and potential aura shifts
5. 🌀 Future quests may reflect or respond to your truth

---

## 🧬 Is My Data Safe?

Yes.
- All data is stored using **quantum-resistant encryption**
- You can remove or amend disclosures at any time
- Your XP growth does not depend on severity, but sincerity

---

## 🧭 You Choose Your Depth

This system is *opt-in only*. The deeper you go, the more accurate EdenQuest becomes — but you set the pace.

> “You don’t need to relive the pain. You only need to be honest about it.”
