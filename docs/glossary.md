# 📘 Eden Protocol Glossary

> This document defines the symbolic, psychological, and technical vocabulary used across EdenQuest. These terms are used in code, schema definitions, user interfaces, quests, and DAO governance.

---

## 🧠 Avatar & Archetype System

**Essence** – The user's MBTI personality type that determines their archetype class.

**Archetype** – Symbolic identity role within EdenQuest:
- Builder 🛠️ (Fire)
- Guardian 🛡️ (Earth)
- Healer 💧 (Water)
- Strategist 🧬 (Air)

**Aura** – Visual expression of psychological alignment; determined by MBTI, EQ, and moral foundation.

**Conviction Glyph** – A symbolic glyph representing the user's dominant moral foundation (e.g. ☯ for Truth, 🜁 for Discipline).

**Soulform** – A metamorphic transformation unlocked by alignment, discipline, and voluntary disclosure. It is not a costume, but a consequence.

**Soulform Visuals** – Dynamic visual FX rendered in the avatar: shimmer overlays, elemental body shaders, aura pulses, and movement changes based on soulform state.

**Transformation Threshold** – The trait-based and narrative requirements needed to unlock a soulform, tied to the Tree of Life, XP, and personal quests.

---

## 🌳 Tree of Life System

**Tree of Life** – A visual and structural metaphor for the user's inner development. Each branch reflects a core trait:
- `discipline`
- `resilience`
- `mindfulness`
- `expression`
- `physical_care`
- `emotional_regulation`

**Trait** – Quantified dimension of behavioral health and symbolic alignment (0–100).

**Decay** – Gradual reduction of a trait’s value due to neglect, misalignment, or contradiction of archetypal intent.

**Growth Stimulus** – Symbolic reinforcement of a trait through rituals, quests, or reflective actions.

**Disclosure Adjustment** – Trait modification based on voluntary trauma or diagnostic inputs, handled securely through symbolic transformation.

**Realignment Quest** – A required mythic trial triggered when Tree health falls too low or XP is locked due to contradiction.

---

## 📈 XP & Leveling System

**XP (Experience Points)** – A symbolic metric of inner growth, transformation, and behavioral follow-through.

**XP Lockout** – When a user acts in violation of their avatar's archetypal path, XP is frozen until restoration via quest.

**Merit Level** – The user’s cumulative level derived from earned XP.

**MeritCoin** – A soulbound, non-tradable proof of transformation recorded on-chain.

**zkXP Commit** – A Zero-Knowledge Proof recording of symbolic experience gain used to validate truth without exposing personal data.

---

## 🧙 Quest System

**EdenQuest** – Daily or symbolic missions generated by AI based on user profile.

**Shadow Quest** – A mythic challenge triggered by personal conflict, stagnation, or dishonesty.

**Hero Quest** – The user's overarching character arc, often aligned with their sacred path and vocation.

**Legacy Trial** – A high-difficulty narrative arc available only to those who have completed a soulform transformation.

**Ash Realm** – A procedurally generated dungeon unlocked by Phoenix-class soulforms, testing emotional regulation, sacrifice, and rebirth.

**Voice Roles**:
- Mentor 🧙 – Wise guide  
- Echo 🜃 – Shadow or resistance voice  
- Inner Voice 🧬 – Reflective narrative overlay  

---

## 🔐 DAO & Governance Terms

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** – Collective decision-making engine built on proposal/vote mechanisms.

**Truth Integrity** – Symbolic behavioral consistency score influencing DAO privileges.

**Soulbound Proposal** – A governance submission tied to verified personal growth.

**ZK Commit** – Zero-Knowledge Proof used to verify XP, health, or alignment without exposing raw data.

---

## 🌍 Systemic Metaphors

**World Tree** – Collective health gauge of the Eden system based on user Tree states and symbolic contributions.

**XP Commit Chain** – Immutable log of soulbound transformation events and verified progression.

**Token-Gated Access** – Restricts content based on internal maturity, not fiat payment.

**Mythic Dungeon** – A procedurally generated symbolic space requiring Tree, XP, and aura alignment to enter.

---

## 🧬 Design Principles

**Symbolic Immersion** – Everything in Eden mirrors psychological growth through archetypal metaphors.

**Trauma-Informed UX** – Language, sound, and feedback loops are non-invasive, soft, and always optional.

**Presence over Performance** – Eden rewards truth, not speed. Healing is not gamified.
