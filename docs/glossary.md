# 📘 Eden Protocol Glossary

> This document defines the symbolic, psychological, and technical vocabulary used across EdenQuest. These terms are used in code, schema definitions, user interfaces, quests, and DAO governance.

---

## 🧠 Avatar & Archetype System

**Essence** – The user's MBTI personality type that determines their archetype class.

**Archetype** – Symbolic identity role within EdenQuest:
- Builder 🛠️ (Fire)
- Guardian 🛡️ (Earth)
- Healer 💧 (Water)
- Strategist 🧬 (Air)

**Aura** – Visual expression of psychological alignment; determined by MBTI, EQ, and moral foundation.

**Conviction Glyph** – A symbolic glyph representing the user's dominant moral foundation (e.g. ☯ for Truth, 🜁 for Discipline).

**Sacred Path** – The user’s declared spiritual alignment. Affects aura tint, quest tone, and symbolic access. Must align with the canonical whitelist and is never used for identity profiling.

---

## 🌳 Tree of Life System

**Tree of Life** – A visual and structural metaphor for the user's inner development. Each branch reflects a core trait (e.g. Discipline, Mindfulness, Expression).

**Trait** – Quantified dimension of behavioral health and symbolic alignment (0–100).

**Decay** – Visual signal and trait degeneration due to neglect, misalignment, or inconsistency.

**Realignment Quest** – A mandatory symbolic trial to restore tree integrity and resume XP gain.

---

## 📈 XP & Leveling System

**XP (Experience Points)** – A symbolic metric of inner growth, transformation, and behavioral follow-through.

**XP Lockout** – When a user acts in violation of their avatar's archetypal path, XP is frozen until restoration via quest.

**Merit Level** – The user’s cumulative level derived from earned XP.

**MeritCoin** – A soulbound, non-tradable proof of transformation recorded on-chain.

---

## 🧙 Quest System

**EdenQuest** – Daily or symbolic missions generated by AI based on user profile.

**Shadow Quest** – A more intense mythic challenge triggered by inner conflict or ethical breakdown (e.g. lying, relapse, stagnation).

**Hero Quest** – The user’s macro narrative arc, often tied to their Calling trait (e.g. RIASEC outcome).

**Group Ritual** – A multiplayer, opt-in cooperative quest where users unite to overcome symbolic archetypes of trauma. Requires group opt-in and aura sync; success is measured through resonance, not performance.

**Voice Roles**:
- Mentor 🧙 – Wise guide, offers affirmation and direction
- Echo 🜃 – Antagonist or subconscious fear response
- Inner Voice 🧬 – Reflective or introspective overlay during quests

---

## 🔐 DAO & Governance Terms

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** – A proposal and vote mechanism run by verified users.

**Truth Integrity** – A hidden score determined by the system to assess behavioral honesty and quest alignment.

**Soulbound Proposal** – A DAO action tied to a user's proven behavioral journey (not transferable).

**ZK Commit** – Zero-Knowledge Proof cryptographic hash to verify growth without exposing private data.

**Truth Synergy** – A resonance score generated during multiplayer rituals that reflects the symbolic cohesion of all participants. High synergy enables deeper quest penetration and sacred content unlocks.

---

## 🌍 Systemic Metaphors

**World Tree** – A collective dashboard that reflects the symbolic and moral health of all users.

**XP Commit Chain** – Immutable record of all user progress validated through ZK signatures.

**Token-Gated Access** – Areas or actions that require symbolic maturity, not fiat or purchase.

**Mythic Dungeon** – A symbolic, procedurally generated VR encounter tied to internal transformation.

**Glyph Chat** – Nonverbal, symbolic messaging system based on conviction glyphs. Allows meaningful communication during quests and DAO rituals without traditional text or speech.

---

## 🧬 Design Principles

**Symbolic Immersion** – User experience is crafted as a modern myth that mirrors psychological change.

**Trauma-Informed UX** – No coercive triggers, high transparency, soft voice reinforcement, optional bypasses.

**Presence over Performance** – Eden rewards authenticity, self-honesty, and follow-through—not efficiency or optimization.
