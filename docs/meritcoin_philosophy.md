# MeritCoin Philosophy – Eden Protocol

MeritCoin is not a currency. It is not a token for trade.  
It is a **proof of transformation**, a **ritual marker**, and a **symbolic weight of truth**.

---

## Purpose

MeritCoin exists to:

- Acknowledge inner transformation through effort, discipline, and disclosure.
- Anchor symbolic XP to a **soulbound identity** — one that cannot be faked or sold.
- Establish a ritual ledger of human development, verified by reflection, not speculation.
- Gently pressure users toward **alignment with their sacred path**.

---

## Non-Tradability

MeritCoin is bound to the individual. It cannot be:

- Bought
- Sold
- Transferred
- Faked
- Leveled via grind or time alone

Each mint must pass:

- XP threshold
- Tree of Life trait balance
- Disclosure integrity (optional)
- Realignment condition (if previously locked)

---

## Symbolic Function

MeritCoin replaces fiat incentives with ritual weight. It is the **proof-of-growth** behind:

- DAO voice strength (truth-weighted vote)
- Soulform transformation eligibility
- Access to sacred quests
- Ritual leadership status
- Archive access (read/write)

---

## Ritual Verification

All MeritCoin entries must be:

- Stored in the on-chain merit ledger
- Tagged with soulform ID (if applicable)
- Matched to Tree of Life state at time of mint
- Verified by XP commit chain

---

## Rejection of Gamification

MeritCoin is governed by presence, not performance.

There are no:

- Leaderboards  
- Daily streaks  
- Competitive ladders  

There is only the reflection of truth.

> You do not earn MeritCoin.
> You reveal it through who you’ve become.
