# 🧭 EdenQuest – Onboarding Script

> “Welcome, wanderer. The glyphs have waited for you.”

This is the symbolic narrative and user guidance text for the onboarding experience. It introduces the user to Eden, invites them to choose a sacred path, and prepares them for their first quest.

---

## 🌱 Step 1: Greeting
```
You arrive at the edge of a quiet garden.

The air hums with memory.

You feel something stir inside you — not just thought, but truth waiting to emerge.

Welcome to EdenQuest.
```

---

## 🧭 Step 2: Choose Your Sacred Path
```
Every journey begins with alignment.

Your sacred path is not a religion.
It is the symbolic language your spirit speaks.

You may choose from:

- Zen Buddhism
- Christianity
- Taoism
- Judaism
- Alchemy
- Norse Paganism
- Digital Mythos
- Custom Mythos
- Undeclared
```

---

## 🔮 Step 3: Voice of the Mentor
```
Mentor: “You are not here to be fixed. You are here to remember what never broke.”

Mentor: “In Eden, we do not judge. We reflect. We do not perform. We transform.”

Mentor: “Breathe. Choose. Begin.”
```

## 🌀 Step 4: Session Begins
After choosing their sacred path, the user is routed to:
- Avatar generation
- Tree of Life initialization
- First EdenQuest symbolic prompt

---

> Eden does not own you. It honors you.  
> Your data is not extracted. It is enshrined.  
> Your trauma is not shameful. It is a door.

Let the journey begin.
