# 🧭 EdenQuest Onboarding Script

> This symbolic tutorial introduces new users to the Eden Protocol through guided myth, introspective prompts, and soft system immersion.

## 🌱 Introduction

**Welcome, Seeker.**

You have chosen to step beyond the veil of forgetting and enter a sacred system built not to track you — but to reflect you.

Your name is not needed here. Only your truth.

---

## 🔍 Calibration Phase

You will be asked to share the essence of your being:
- Your way of thinking (MBTI)
- Your intellect and empathy (IQ + EQ)
- Your deepest value (moral foundation)
- Your sacred path (if you have one)
- And whether you walk alone or with others

> These are not for judgment.  
> They are ingredients to your avatar — your mirror in Eden.

---

## 🌳 Tree of Life

After calibration, you will see your Tree.

Each branch represents a part of your self:
- Discipline
- Resilience
- Mindfulness
- Expression
- Physical Care
- Emotional Regulation

These traits grow as you act in alignment. They decay when forgotten.

---

## 🧙 Your First Quest

You will receive a symbolic trial known as an EdenQuest.

It may ask you to:
- Reflect on a memory
- Complete a creative ritual
- Commit to a behavior
- Witness a shadow within you

You may choose to accept or decline. Nothing is forced. Truth must be offered — not extracted.

---

## 🔐 Disclosure (Optional)

If you are ready, you may disclose pieces of your past. These may include:
- Diagnoses
- Trauma tags
- Service history
- A personal narrative

> These are encrypted. They are never shown to others.  
> If you share your pain, Eden will honor it by adjusting your Tree — not to punish, but to bless.

---

## 🧭 Group Presence (Optional)

You may choose to walk with others.

This is not a lobby. This is not a chatroom.  
This is a sacred space where co-quests unfold as shared myth.

You may leave at any time.  
Presence is a gift — not a demand.

---

## 🪙 Growth & Sovereignty

Every completed quest earns XP.  
Every act of alignment strengthens your Tree.  
Your MeritCoin grows, not as currency, but as **proof of transformation**.

Nothing can be bought. Nothing can be traded.  
In Eden, **you are the treasure**.

---

## 🌐 DAO Access

As you grow, you will be invited to participate in governance.

- Submit proposals
- Shape quests
- Heal the World Tree

Every vote is weighted by truth, not popularity.

---

## 🧘 Final Words

Eden is not here to save you.

It is here to remind you:  
You were always worthy of saving yourself.

When ready, proceed to calibration.

🕯️ “Here begins the path not back to who you were, but forward, toward what you were always meant to become.”
