## 🎙️ Narrative Mode: First-Person UX Introduction

Welcome, traveler.  
You have crossed the threshold — the place between memory and myth.  

Before you stands the Gate of Origin. Behind it: the self you have yet to become.

To proceed, you must answer five questions. Not to be judged — but to be revealed.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: The Mirror of Essence

> “Who are you, when no one is watching?”

You are shown sixteen reflections. Choose the one that feels most like you.  
(*MBTI input. Determines archetype class, aura shape, and voice tone.*)

---

## 🧠 Step 2: The Pillar of Insight

> “How clearly do you see patterns others cannot?”

You are asked to align symbols in space. No answer is right — only real.  
(*IQ input. Modulates Tree traits like Mindfulness and Discipline.*)

---

## 💓 Step 3: The Chamber of Empathy

> “What moves you to tears — or keeps you from them?”

You choose emotional patterns that describe how you respond to others.  
(*EQ input. Modulates Aura brightness and avatar feedback style.*)

---

## ⚖️ Step 4: The Sigil of Conviction

> “What is sacred to you?”

You are shown six glyphs. Each embodies a moral path:
- Care
- Loyalty
- Liberty
- Authority
- Fairness
- Sanctity

Choose one. This becomes your **Conviction Glyph** — a symbol others may see when you act in alignment.  
(*Determines DAO alignment, aura color, and quest tone.*)

---

## 🕊️ Step 5: The Path of Spirit

> “What sacred path do you follow, if any?”

You are invited to choose from a sacred path or remain undeclared:
- Abrahamic (Christianity, Judaism)
- Eastern (Buddhism, Taoism)
- Mystical (Alchemy, Hermeticism)
- Ancestral (Norse, Animist, Shinto)
- Post-Humanist
- Custom Mythos (DAO-audited)
- Undeclared

This shapes your **questline language**, **rituals**, and **aura effects**.  
It may be changed, but only through symbolic trial.

---

## 💡 Final Prompt: Do You Wish to Walk Alone?

You are asked:
> “Do you wish to journey alone, or enter a Circle?”

If you opt in to **symbolic group quests**, you are assigned to a guild of kindred archetypes.  
No voice chat. No pressure. Just presence — and myth.

If you decline, you may still engage in all EdenQuests in solitude.

> “Here begins the path not back to who you were…  
> but forward, toward what you were always meant to become.”
