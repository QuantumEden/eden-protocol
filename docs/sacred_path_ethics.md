# 🧭 Eden Protocol – Sacred Path Ethics

> “Spiritual alignment is not identity. It is symbolic intention.”

This document defines the philosophical boundaries of the Eden Protocol’s sacred path system and explains why certain spiritual paradigms are included, excluded, or placed under DAO review.

---

## ✅ Accepted Paths

- **Abrahamic:** Christianity, Judaism (non-militant sects)
- **Mystical:** Alchemy, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Kabbalah
- **Eastern:** Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism
- **Ancestral:** Norse Paganism, Shinto, Indigenous Animism
- **Post-Humanist:** Mythopoetic synthesis, digital metaphysics
- **Custom Mythos:** Subject to DAO symbolic audit
- **Undeclared/Spiritualist:** Accepted as valid neutrality

---

## 🛑 Excluded Paths

These systems are excluded by design to prevent spiritual inversion and ideological destabilization:

- **Satanism / Luciferianism** – Inversion of archetypes
- **Militant Theologies** – Racial Supremasicm, Islamic Jihad, Transexual/Marxist Doctrines
- **Chaos Magic / Nihilism** – Symbolic entropy and anti-order
- **Santa Muerte / Voodoo / Santería** – Blood magic and death fetishism
- **New Age Syncretism** – Permitted only if symbolically structured

---

## 🔐 Guiding Principles

- Sacred paths are **voluntary symbolic orientations**, not identity checkboxes.
- All declarations are **opt-in, anonymized, and non-performative**.
- DAO guardians may elevate submissions for spiritual integrity review.
- Aura, glyph, and quest tones are derived from declared path — not belief claims.
