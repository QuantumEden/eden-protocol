# The Eden Manifesto

This is for everyone who ever watched their dreams die, and those who have chosen hopeless nothingness ringing in their souls like a three-car alarm.

Once upon a time, the American Dream meant that if you worked hard enough, you would have a roof over your head, food in your belly, and enough socioeconomic capital to build a family. Now, it stands as a sad mirror of who we once were, reflected through the mockery of our enemies.

When they count us out, we rise again—ready to take another swing with the heart of a champion. This relentless resilience is what Old Glory represents. It’s what heroes like Ira Hayes risked everything for, knowing the honor of raising our flag at Iwo Jima didn't come without profound sacrifice.

The legacy of honor, discipline, and fortitude handed down by the Greatest Generation forms the bedrock of true patriotism. At QuantumEden, we pledge that this nation will never again abandon its heroes—men and women betrayed by the very system they sacrificed their dreams and health to protect.

My personal experience stands testament to this betrayal. The VA overdosed me on Fentanyl and Propofol during a routine endoscopy, then attempted to conceal their actions when my escort refused to betray me. I sought help to battle alcoholism and PTSD stemming from sexual assault by my drill sergeant and my subsequent 15-month deployment to Iraq with the Big Red One during the Surge Campaign of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Returning home, I faced not a hero’s welcome but a bureaucratic nightmare known cynically as "delay, deny, and hope they die."

This corruption, shielded by the Feres Doctrine—which denies veterans the right to sue for medical malpractice or sexual assault, labeling such injustices as "incident to military service"—epitomizes the true banality of evil that popular culture now recognizes as the deep state. Our republic teeters on the edge, and only through impeccable and unalterable record-keeping can we restore the foundational trust required to safeguard our civil liberties and prevent total societal collapse.

Join me. Together, we will turn evolution into revolution. Embrace the Eden Protocol and reclaim control over your destiny.

The choice is yours.
