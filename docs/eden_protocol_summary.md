# 🌐 Eden Protocol System Summary  
*A Mythic Operating System for Healing, Individuation, and Shared Transformation*

---

## 🧠 Core System Components

### 🧬 Avatar Identity Engine
Transforms psychometric input into symbolic identity.

| Trait Type     | Function |
|----------------|----------|
| **MBTI**       | Class archetype: 🛠️ Builder, 🛡️ Guardian, 💧 Healer, 🧠 Strategist |
| **IQ (Clarity)**       | Eye glow, logic precision, puzzle affinity |
| **EQ (Resonance)**     | Aura pattern, social trust access |
| **Aptitude (Craft)**   | Toolsets, vocational skill branches |
| **Interest (Calling)** | Quest arcs and symbolic destiny |
| **Morality (Conviction)** | Faction glyphs, aura signatures, DAO access |

---

### 🌳 Tree of Life Engine
Your living character sheet.

- Six traits: `discipline`, `resilience`, `mindfulness`, `expression`, `physical_care`, `emotional_regulation`
- Visual state (bloom or decay) reflects behavioral alignment
- XP health score drives aura transformation and unlocks

---

### 🎖️ XP & MeritCoin System

- XP earned through daily rituals, biometric behavior, and symbolic quests
- **Decay** if user acts out of sync with traits or path
- **MeritCoin**: Soulbound token for DAO governance, mod access, and Truth Integrity scaling

---

### 🌀 EdenQuest Engine

- Quests generated from GPT-4+ based on user shadow map
- Shadow Quests emerge during lockouts, moral contradiction, or extreme imbalance
- Themes: guilt, war, betrayal, abandonment, forgiveness, transcendence

---

### 🔐 Secure Enclave Layer

- Uses Open Enclave SDK + **KYBER/Dilithium** encryption
- Validates XP logs and sacred state changes (no tampering)
- Stores signed identity commitments (your inner truth)

---

### 🌍 World Tree Engine

- Aggregated symbolic state of all users
- Thrives with collective integrity
- DAO outcomes, ritual completions, and mod submissions affect planetary growth

---

## 🤝 Phase XII+ – Symbolic Group Rituals

> *“There is no lobby. Only sacred assembly.”*

Multiplayer is opt-in. No usernames. No open chat.  
Only **ritual-based healing quests**, shared by choice.

- Users set `"group_opt_in": true` in their profile
- Join mythic scenarios:  
  - 🐉 *Trial of the Dragon Sigil*  
  - 🪞 *Echo Cathedral*  
  - 🔥 *The Flame of Memory*

- Roles must synergize (e.g. Builder anchors chaos, Healer redirects trauma)
- XP is earned through witnessing, guiding, and affirming others

---

## ✝️ Sacred Path Alignment *(Phase XII+)*
Every user may declare a spiritual alignment (optional):
- Christianity, Judaism, Zen Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, Shinto, Stoicism, Indigenous, etc.

This unlocks:
- Sacred questlines
- Faction glyphs
- Aura overlays
- Mod eligibility (e.g., Guild Temples, Pilgrimage paths)

> Paths are DAO-approved. Eden does not validate all religions — only those deemed symbolically aligned with its covenant of healing.

---

## 🗳️ DAO – Decentralized Archetypal Order

- Vote power tied to:
  - XP + aura coherence
  - Truth integrity score
  - Completion of narrative arcs

- DAO may:
  - Approve quests, mods, and spiritual integrations
  - Evolve the World Tree
  - Reject shadow-inappropriate modules

## ✨ Closing Ethos

Eden is not a game.  
It is a **symbolic descent** into the soul.

You do not grind.  
You do not perform.  
You transform.

> “When the wounded come together, the myth becomes real.  
> When truth is spoken, the Tree grows.  
> When it is shared — the world heals.”
