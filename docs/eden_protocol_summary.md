ðŸ§¬ Eden Protocol Executive Summary

I. What Is the Eden Protocol?

The Eden Protocol is a behavioral transformation engine that blends:
	â€¢	Symbolic therapy (CBT, logotherapy, psychoanalysis)
	â€¢	XP-based self-growth system (MeritCoin)
	â€¢	Biometric feedback (HRV, sleep, mindfulness)
	â€¢	Immersive, procedurally-generated AI quests
	â€¢	Zero-knowledge blockchain verification

Eden is not a game. It is an internal architecture of truth â€” built to serve as a healing OS for veterans, trauma survivors, and institutional outliers.

II. Core Components
	â€¢	Tree of Life: Avatar-linked growth tracker, fed by biometric and psychological signals
	â€¢	Avatar Engine: Identity shaped by psychometric tests (MBTI, IQ, EQ, moral alignment)
	â€¢	MeritCoin: Soulbound, non-transferable XP-based token (not for sale)
	â€¢	DAO Governance: Truth-weighted voting tied to actual growth, not speculation
	â€¢	World Tree: Collective emotional state of the Eden ecosystem â€” blooms or decays

III. Why Eden Works
	â€¢	Trauma-aware: Developed by a combat veteran, focused on PTSD, addiction, and moral injury
	â€¢	Gamified healing: Users complete shadow quests based on subconscious blocks
	â€¢	Privacy-first: Cryptographic hashing + biometric gates = no data exploitation
	â€¢	Non-fungible: XP must be earned through truth, verified via symbolic quests
	â€¢	Adaptive: Eden evolves with the user â€” unlocking growth paths, archetypes, and community roles

VII. Ask

We are seeking institutional support, public trust access, or venture alignment to:
	â€¢	Launch the DAO
	â€¢	Deploy the app
	â€¢	Scale Eden across trauma communities

Eden does not want to dominate the world â€” it wants to help the world dominate its demons.
