# 🌐 Eden Protocol System Summary

The Eden Protocol is a cryptographically anchored, psychometrically driven symbolic operating system designed to guide users through psychological individuation, moral alignment, and behavioral healing. Built on modular AI systems, post-quantum blockchain architecture, and narrative ritual mechanics, EdenQuest empowers users to become the hero of their own myth.

## 🧠 Core System Components

### 🧬 Avatar Identity Engine
- MBTI → Class archetype (Builder, Guardian, Healer, Strategist)
- IQ → Eye and logic traits (Clarity)
- EQ → Aura quality and interpersonal dynamics (Resonance)
- Aptitudes → Skill branches (Craft)
- Interests → Quest paths (Calling)
- Morality → Aura glyphs and faction access (Conviction)

### 🌳 Tree of Life Engine
- Six core traits reflect user’s personal wellness branches:
  - Discipline, Resilience, Mindfulness, Expression, Physical Care, Emotional Regulation
- Health score governs XP growth and aura clarity
- Real-world behaviors influence visual state (decay or bloom)

### 🎖️ XP & MeritCoin System
- XP is earned through verified actions, journaling, rituals, and quests
- XP decay occurs if symbolic alignment is broken
- MeritCoin is a non-transferable, soulbound token used for DAO and spiritual economy

### 🌀 EdenQuest Engine
- AI-generated symbolic quests based on user profile and trauma alignment
- Each quest acts as a cognitive and emotional healing experience
- Shadow Quests emerge when XP is locked or moral contradiction is detected

### 🔐 Secure Enclave (Open Enclave SDK)
- Verifies avatar state and XP transactions using KYBER & Dilithium encryption
- Stores identity commitments and behavioral proof-of-truth
- Protects the soulbound integrity of each user

### 🌍 World Tree Engine
- Aggregates health of all users across the Eden Protocol
- Global visualization of symbolic ecosystem
- DAO votes, quest outcomes, and XP ritual chains influence growth

## 🤝 Symbolic Group Rituals (Phase 12+)

**EdenQuest is not a traditional multiplayer game.**

It is a solitary experience with optional symbolic companionship. Group participation is a sacred opt-in process, where users may engage in **cooperative quests** to:
- Face shared trauma symbolically
- Strengthen their own Tree of Life through compassion
- Earn extra XP through *helping others heal*

### Key Features:
- Users opt-in via `group_opt_in: true`
- Group quests are sacred rituals, not lobbies
- Roles, auras, and moral glyphs must balance
- Mythic battles (e.g. The Mirror Court, Trial of Fire, The Dragon Sigil) represent communal wounds

## 🗳️ Eden DAO – Decentralized Archetypal Order

- Voting rights tied to XP, truth integrity, and quest alignment
- DAO may:
  - Unlock world events
  - Trigger symbolic economy shifts
  - Approve mods, quests, and narrative expansions
- Group proposals permitted in Phase 12+

## 🔮 System Architecture Summary

- 💾 Python core logic for simulation, user generation, and payloads
- 🧱 JSON Schemas validate all user inputs
- 🧠 GPT-4+ and ElevenLabs for AI quest output and narrative voice
- 🔐 KYBER + Dilithium for quantum-resistant secure transactions
- 🖥️ Unreal Engine 5 & React for interface and game renderings

## ✨ Summary Ethos

Eden is not an escape. It is a descent into the self.  
You do not play to win. You play to **heal**.  
You are not here to perform. You are here to become.

Whether you walk alone or fight a dragon with five wounded warriors, Eden sees you — and helps you see yourself.

> “The Tree grows when the truth is spoken.  
> The World Tree thrives when truth is shared.”
