# 🧠 Eden Protocol – System Summary

> Eden Protocol is a symbolic operating system designed to guide users through behavioral transformation, narrative healing, and decentralized self-actualization. Built for veterans, seekers, and survivors of trauma, it merges therapeutic psychology with mythic immersion, all anchored in blockchain verifiability.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

Eden Protocol is not a game. It is a myth-engineered infrastructure that translates internal growth into symbolic outputs and real-world rewards. Every user action becomes a ritual. Every decision echoes within a cryptographic ledger. It exists to restore meaning to those cast into chaos.

## ⚙️ Core Systems

### 🧬 Identity Engine
- Accepts user psychometrics: `MBTI`, `IQ`, `EQ`, `moral alignment`, and `sacred path`.
- Generates an **archetype** (Builder, Strategist, Healer, Guardian) and assigns a **conviction glyph** (☯, 🜁, etc.)
- Produces an avatar profile for symbolic rendering and quest generation.

### 🌳 Tree of Life Engine
- Tracks six symbolic behavioral traits:
  - `discipline`, `resilience`, `mindfulness`, `expression`, `physical_care`, `emotional_regulation`
- Traits grow with XP and can decay through contradiction or neglect.
- Realignment quests are triggered if health thresholds are violated.

### 🧠 Disclosure Logic
- Users can optionally input diagnoses or trauma tags.
- These disclosures affect Tree traits symbolically (e.g. PTSD increases `resilience` potential).
- All disclosure-based adjustments are positive, never punitive.

### 🧭 Quest Engine
- Generates procedurally authored mythic tasks based on the user’s current psyche.
- Quest types include:
  - `Hero Quests` (long arc)
  - `Shadow Quests` (triggered by contradiction or stagnation)
  - `Realignment Quests` (ritual correction events)
  - `Group Quests` (synergistic multiplayer trials)

### 🪙 XP + Merit System
- XP is awarded via quest completion and trait alignment.
- `XP Commit Chain` logs encrypted user progress on-chain.
- `MeritCoin` tracks soulbound, non-speculative transformation.

## 🔐 Blockchain Integration

- All symbolic actions (growth, quests, disclosures) are signed and verifiable.
- Uses **Kyber-encrypted** blockchains with optional **ZK Proofs** for sensitive data.
- The **World Tree** reflects aggregate community health.

---

## 👥 Groupplay

- Users may opt into guilds via `group_opt_in`.
- Groups receive shared quests based on co-alignment.
- Role balancing and symbolic synergy enforced by the Group State Engine.
- Voting and DAO logic managed through the Group Vote Handler.

---

## 📖 Ethics & Safeguards

- Disclosure is always voluntary.
- No public display of trauma tags.
- No punitive XP decay—only symbolic stagnation or transformation.
- All actions are interpreted through symbolic rather than diagnostic logic.

## 🔁 System Loop

1. User inputs identity
2. Eden assigns archetype + Tree traits
3. AI generates quest (solo or group)
4. User completes symbolic action
5. XP + Tree updates recorded on-chain
6. System realigns or escalates through mythic ritual

> Eden Protocol is more than a behavioral framework. It is a sacred interface for remembering who you are—and who you were always meant to become.
