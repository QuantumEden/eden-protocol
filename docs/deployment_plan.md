# 🚀 Eden Protocol – Deployment Plan

> 🧭 Outlines the phased roadmap for launching Eden Protocol across simulation, prototype, and public DAO infrastructure. This includes grant pathways, biometric integration, and symbolic governance.

---

## 🌱 Phase I: Simulation & Internal Prototyping *(Now)*

### ✅ Completed:
- Core Python backend modules
- Symbolic simulation layers (Avatar Engine, XP, Tree of Life, Quests)
- DAO proposal + XP-weighted voting system
- Blockchain-ready payload architecture (Kyber/Dilithium prep)

### 🛠️ To Execute:
- Final biometric input → Tree of Life integration
- Local test of DAO commit hash verification
- Symbolic testnet for World Tree simulation loop

### 📦 Deliverables:
- GitHub repository with `README.md`, schemas, and contributor docs
- Developer onboarding flow (VR and UI integrations)

---

## 🌳 Phase II: App Prototyping & Grant Targeting *(Q2)*

### 🛠️ Action Items:
- Convert `/docs/eden_mobile_ui.md` to interactive prototype (Figma or React Native)
- Integrate mock API endpoints for frontend testing
- Connect wearable input data to biometric trait engine

### 🎯 Grant Targets:
- 🎮 Epic MegaGrants – Symbolic UE5 dungeon architecture (future integration)
- 🧬 NSF SBIR – Behavioral & cognitive science tools
- 🧠 NIMH / PTSD therapy frameworks
- 🛡️ DARPA – Soldier optimization systems
- 🇺🇸 VA Innovation Office – Veteran trauma protocols

> ⚠️ Unreal Engine 5 is the **target XR deployment environment**, but will not be used in prototyping phases. All symbolic logic, visual assets, and narrative loops are being built with future UE5 integration in mind.

### 📦 Deliverables:
- Working Tree of Life mobile prototype
- 2-page Eden Protocol strategic summary
- Full stakeholder pitch deck (Phase III)

---

## 🌍 Phase III: Public Pilot & DAO Activation *(Q3–Q4)*

### 🛠️ Action Items:
- Private alpha test with 25–50 veterans
- Launch XP-based DAO for symbolic governance
- Deploy EdenChain testnet or Polygon/ZK-L2 bridge
- Begin onboarding symbolic archetypes: Builder, Healer, Guardian, Strategist

### 📣 Public-Facing Tools:
- Eden Protocol explainer trailer (2–3 min)
- Public World Tree dashboard (real-time state)
- Hero Quest onboarding and XP tutorial path

### 📦 Deliverables:
- Live soulbound XP smart contract
- DAO platform accessible to verified contributors
- Validation reports for grant programs + Phase II metrics

## 🧬 Ongoing Quarterly Milestones *(Post-Launch)*

| Quarter     | Milestone Description                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Q1 2026     | Begin Unreal Engine 5 symbolic dungeon development         |
| Q2 2026     | Launch cross-platform XR avatar renderer (VR + mobile)     |
| Q3 2026     | Global onboarding campaign for EdenDAO                     |
| Q4 2026     | Symbolic economy beta: DAO grants + mythic reward tiers    |
