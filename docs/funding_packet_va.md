# VA Funding Proposal â€“ Eden Protocol

## ğŸ”¹ Proposal Title:
**Eden Protocol â€“ A Veteran-Coded System of Symbolic Healing**

---

## ğŸ”¸ Executive Summary

The Eden Protocol is a modular, trauma-informed healing system designed by and for veterans.  
It combines psychometric introspection, symbolic ritual, and soulbound transformation through immersive, procedurally generated quests.

Eden is not a game.  
It is not a diagnosis engine.  
It is a sacred mirror.

This proposal requests support from the Department of Veterans Affairs to pilot Eden Protocol as a **non-pharmaceutical, non-clinical adjunct** to traditional trauma recovery frameworks â€” prioritizing autonomy, dignity, and transformation over compliance and surveillance.

## ğŸ”¸ Funding Purpose

The requested funding would support:

1. MVP Deployment to Veteran Test Group
2. Trauma-Informed VR/Mobile Interface Completion
3. DAO-Based Peer Ritual Governance System
4. Soulform + Tree of Life Realignment Infrastructure
5. Onboarding + Disclosure Pipelines with Military Cultural Safeguards

## ğŸ”¸ Problem

Veterans are:

- Over-medicated and under-heard  
- Diagnosed but not integrated  
- Spiritually fragmented by procedural systems  
- Often treated as cases, not individuals

Traditional systems suppress symptoms.  
Eden Protocol mirrors truth and rewards self-awareness.

---

## ğŸ”¸ Solution

Eden provides:

- Voluntary trauma input with symbolic growth feedback  
- Voice-guided quests through mythic trial formats  
- XP + realignment paths based on behavior, not bureaucracy  
- A soulbound record of transformation via the MeritCoin system  
- DAO participation that honors ritual, not rank

---

## ğŸ”¸ Alignment with VA Goals

This pilot aligns with:

- **Whole Health Initiative**
- **Veteran-Centered Design Pilot Programs**
- **AI & Telehealth Integrations**
- **Moral Injury & Non-Diagnostic Recovery Models**
