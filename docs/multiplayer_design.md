# 🧙‍♀️ EdenQuest Multiplayer Design – Mythic Group Rituals, Not Social Gaming

> "When the wounded fight the shadow together, it’s not about victory.

## 🎮 What Multiplayer Means in EdenQuest

EdenQuest does not feature traditional multiplayer gameplay.  
There are no voice chats.  
No public lobbies.  
No usernames flashing across screens.  

Instead, there is **ritual co-presence** — opt-in group quests where players may choose to witness and assist others in a shared symbolic experience. These events are optional, narrative-driven, and designed to reinforce spiritual individuation and psychological support.

## 🧭 Core Design Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🧘 Solitude is sacred | All gameplay is solo by default. Group quests are elective. |
| 🤝 Presence, not performance | There is no competition — only witness, support, and shared resonance. |
| 🛡️ Trauma-safe architecture | No verbal interaction required. No exposure of personal history. |
| 🎭 Symbolic support roles | Players assist each other via archetypes (Mentor, Echo Breaker, Shadow Anchor). |
| 🔄 XP earned through empathy | Helping others grants symbolic XP — not power, but perspective. |

## 🕯️ Group Rituals (Quest Types)

### 🔹 **Trial of the Five**
Five players, each aligned with one Tree branch, confront a manifestation of collective trauma (e.g., war guilt, addiction).  
Each must perform a symbolic action to weaken the “shadow boss.”

### 🔹 **Echo Cathedral**
Two players navigate a mirrored dungeon of intrusive memories.  
They walk side-by-side, never meeting directly, solving puzzles by echoing patterns in each other's symbolic environment.

### 🔹 **Path of Restoration**
One player journeys through a fragmented vision of self, while three support from outside by casting light into different domains of the Tree.

## 🔐 Safety Protocols

- No open matchmaking
- Group quests must be **unlocked via XP + Tree alignment**
- Players can leave a ritual at any time without penalty
- All interactions are abstracted (no real names, no chat)
- All participants must **opt-in** before symbolic link is formed

## ✨ Why This Matters

Because some battles can’t be won alone.  
Because the first step to healing isn’t fixing — it’s being seen.

**Eden is not a game.**  
**It is a ceremony.**

And when the rite is shared, the myth becomes true.
