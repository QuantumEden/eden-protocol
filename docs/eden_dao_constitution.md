# 🏛️ Eden DAO Constitution (Amended for Modding Tier)

## 🌐 Overview
The Eden Protocol DAO is a soulbound XP-governed collective that governs symbolic infrastructure, truth protocols, therapeutic rituals, and now, community-submitted mods.

- 🏗️ **Architect (XP 300–499):** Propose core upgrades and ritual adjustments
- 🎨 **Mod Architect (XP 500+):** Propose symbolic mods, rituals, or lessons — may vote on mod integrations
- 🦁 **Council (XP 1000+):** Shape DAO direction, grant XP, and guide symbolic law

## 🗳️ Proposal Types

- 🧱 **Core Upgrade:** Structural improvements (blockchain, DAO logic, etc.)
- 🌑 **Shadow Protocol:** Symbolic therapy alterations (quests, pathfinding, integration)
- 🧘 **Mod Proposal:** New symbolic rituals, practices, or trait-growth modules

---

## 🔨 Mod Proposal Lifecycle

1. ✍️ **Creation:** Modder creates a valid `mod_manifest.json`, glyph, and symbolic practice or quest.
2. 🧾 **Commitment:** Submitted with XP-weighted signature and hashed metadata.
3. 🗳️ **Review:** Voted on by Mod Architects and above using DAO `MOD_PROPOSAL` path.
4. 🌀 **Integration:** Once approved, mod is:
   - Added to `mod_registry.py`
   - Activated via `mod_loader`
   - Reflected in World Tree vitality and trait branches

## 🕊️ Modding Guidelines (Symbolic Law)

Mods must embody the values of:
- ✨ Healing over harm
- 🧘 Self-discipline over indulgence
- 🌳 Growth over performance
- 🔮 Myth over mechanics

Each mod must define:
- 🜁 Symbolic Glyph (elemental alignment)
- 🧠 Trait Target (e.g. discipline, resilience)
- 🎓 XP Range (≤100 XP per instance)
- 🔐 Truth Gate (e.g. biometric, journal proof, behavioral logs)

🚫 Mods exploiting trauma, promoting deception, or duplicating existing paths will be nullified by DAO vote.

🕯️ The addition of modding marks a shift:
**Eden is no longer just a system. It is a living temple of healing and myth, built not only by its founders, but by all who walk the path with purpose.**
