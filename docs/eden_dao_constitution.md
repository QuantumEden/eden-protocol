📜 Eden DAO Constitution

🧭 Purpose

To encode symbolic justice into a decentralized governance protocol that rewards integrity, transformation, and merit.

The Eden DAO governs:
	•	XP-weighted decisions
	•	Ecosystem proposals (quests, funding, sanctuary design)
	•	Truth integrity enforcement
	•	Aura evolution policies

⸻

🗳️ Voting System
	•	Votes weighted by verified XP

	•	ZK vote verification without raw XP exposure (future layer)

	•	≥ 60% of weighted XP votes “yes”

🧬 Proposal Format (Symbolic)

Each DAO proposal must:
	1.	Present a glyph representing its principle (e.g., ☯ for balance)
	2.	Provide a mythic narrative: the problem as a symbolic imbalance
	3.	Suggest an actionable ritual (e.g., new quest, new sanctuary path)
	4.	Define XP cost and World Tree impact

Example:

Glyph: 🜁 (Discipline)
Title: “Restructure the Forgiveness Trials”
Narrative: “Too many avoid shadow quests. The discipline branch decays…”

⸻

🌳 World Tree Synchronization
	•	DAO decisions modify collective Eden Vitality Index
	•	If vitality drops below 50%, “Decay Protocol” initiates:
	•	All XP gains reduced 25%
	•	Shadow Quests doubled in frequency
	•	If vitality exceeds 85%:
	•	Unlock global raid quests
	•	Boost XP growth by 15% for all users

⸻

🛡️ Security & Oversight
	•	DAO secured via Open Enclave SDK
	•	All DAO records committed to EdenChain
	•	Council (Elder tier+) has 1-vote veto override (useable once per season)
	•	Proposals violating symbolic ethics (e.g., zero-cost growth) are auto-flagged

⸻

⚖️ Amendment Rules
	•	Constitution may evolve only if:
	•	≥ 70% Elder XP-weighted approval
	•	Signed by minimum 3 Architect-tier contributors

This document is sacred. It binds Eden’s meritocracy to truth and myth, ensuring the garden does not become another empire of lies.
