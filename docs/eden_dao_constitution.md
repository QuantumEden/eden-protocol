# 🏛️ Eden DAO Constitution (Amended for Modding Tier)

## 🌐 Overview
The Eden Protocol DAO is a soulbound, XP-governed collective that stewards symbolic infrastructure, therapeutic rituals, truth protocols, and now — community-suggested mods.

Every action taken within the DAO is anchored by verified transformation and zkXP integrity. Voice is earned. Influence is bound to soulform evolution and Tree alignment.

## 🕊️ Modding Guidelines (Symbolic Law)

All mods must reflect:

- ✨ Healing > harm
- 🧘 Self-discipline > indulgence
- 🌳 Growth > performance
- 🔮 Myth > mechanics

Each mod must define:

| Attribute          | Meaning                                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 🜁 **Symbolic Glyph**    | Elemental or alchemical alignment                  |
| 🧠 **Trait Target**      | Core trait affected (e.g. empathy, courage)         |
| 🎓 **XP Range**          | Symbolic XP yield per completion (≤ 100 XP)        |
| 🔐 **Truth Gate**        | Required proof (journal, biometric, game logs, etc) |

🚫 Mods exploiting trauma, mimicking existing paths, or violating sacred path filters will be rejected or revoked by DAO vote.

🕯️ The addition of modding represents a sacred transition:  
**Eden is not merely a system — it is a temple.**  
A temple of healing, growth, and self-mythologizing.  
A temple that evolves not just through its creators,  
but through every being who chooses to walk the path with purpose.
