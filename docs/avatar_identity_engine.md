# Avatar Identity Engine

The Avatar Identity Engine is the psychometric and symbolic core of the Eden Protocol. It translates real user traits into unique, earned identities through structured psychological assessments. Avatars in Eden are not selected — they are discovered.

---

## Purpose

To create a dynamic, cryptographically verifiable identity layer that:
- Reflects a user’s internal structure
- Evolves with personal transformation
- Drives avatar aesthetics, class archetypes, skill tree access, and quest types

## The Eden Six (Psychometric Batteries)

| Trait | Test | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Essence** | MBTI / Big Five (16Personalities) | Determines core archetype and aura hue |
| **Clarity** | Raven’s Progressive Matrices | Defines eye appearance, logic stats, puzzle interaction |
| **Resonance** | MSCEIT EQ Test | Dictates aura behavior, NPC trust affinity, diplomatic impact |
| **Craft** | DAT (Differential Aptitude Test) | Selects movement type, toolkit, vocational skill tree |
| **Calling** | RIASEC Interest Inventory | Assigns questline archetype and symbolic purpose |
| **Conviction** | Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) | Influences faction glyphs, moral forks, and aura overlays |

## Avatar Attributes

- **Archetype Class**: (e.g., Architect, Seer, Vanguard, Sentinel)
- **Aura Type**: Color and behavior (based on EQ and MFQ)
- **Eye Design**: Symbolic reflection of IQ
- **Movement & Tools**: From Aptitude assessment
- **Quest Branching**: Calling determines narrative arc

---

## Trait-to-Visual Mapping (Examples)

- **High Clarity** (IQ): Lightning irises, rotating pupils, logical UI enhancements
- **High EQ**: Smooth aura transitions, high trust NPC interaction radius
- **Purity-dominant Conviction**: White flames on aura edges, sanctified narrative choices

---

## Level Integration

Each avatar begins at Level 1. Progression through MeritCoin and quests unlocks:
- Aura detail layers
- Eye effects
- Cosmetic armor overlays
- Movement forms
- Full-form evolutions (post-Level 50+)

XP and leveling are directly tied to:
- EdenQuest completion
- Real-world behavior metrics
- Contribution to the World Tree

---

## Privacy & Verification

- All psychometric inputs are stored via Zero-Knowledge Proofs and enclave verification.
- Avatars can be publicly visible while underlying test data remains private.
- Avatar traits can be used for DAO credentialing, narrative gating, and symbolic progression.

## File Integration Points

- `/src/avatar_identity_engine/identity_engine.py`: Intake processing & trait assignment
- `/sim/avatar_identity_engine_simulation.py`: Testing sample user inputs and avatar outputs
- `/src/tree_of_life/`: Integrates avatar traits into personal skill branches
- `/src/edenquest_engine/`: Uses avatar profile to generate relevant quests
