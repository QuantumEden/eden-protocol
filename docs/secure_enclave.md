# Secure Enclave – Eden Protocol

The Secure Enclave is the cryptographic guardian of user truth within the Eden Protocol. It serves as an air-gapped, offline logic module responsible for verifying psychometric integrity and behavioral claims without compromising privacy or security.

---

## Purpose
- Ensure **truthful input** of psychometric and behavioral data
- Provide **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** (ZKPs) or signed tokens for system integration
- Protect against falsified avatars, XP inflation, or DAO exploitation

---

## Core Functions

### 1. **Local Verification Engine**
- Processes raw psychometric results (MBTI, IQ, EQ, etc.)
- Validates input through checksum, device ID, or biometric proof
- Signs results with a local private key

### 2. **ZKP Generator**
- Outputs anonymized attestations of verified traits (e.g., “High EQ: verified”)
- Ensures modules like the Tree of Life and Avatar Engine operate on valid data

### 3. **XP Unlock Node**
- Locks MeritCoin progress if inputs are flagged as invalid or falsified
- Provides override logic only after real-world healing quests or re-verification

### 4. **DAO Voter Credentialing**
- Only validated user profiles receive governance weight in the DAO
- Prevents spoofing of avatars, trees, or XP via external attacks

## Integration Points

| Module | Interaction |
|--------|-------------|
| `identity_engine.py` | Signs psychometric truth before avatar assignment |
| `tree_of_life_engine.py` | Verifies behavior logs before branch growth |
| `leveling_system.py` | Locks or unlocks XP channels |
| `governance_engine.py` | Issues verified credentials for weighted votes |

---

## Privacy & Hardware Compatibility
- Works with encrypted local storage
- Optional biometric verification (e.g., Face ID, fingerprint)
- Can run on mobile hardware, air-gapped Linux devices, or embedded chips

---

## Example Workflow
1. User submits encrypted MBTI test result
2. Secure Enclave checks format, device signature, biometric hash
3. If valid → signs payload → avatar + Tree of Life creation unlocked
4. If invalid → MeritCoin XP locked → EdenQuest healing quest required
