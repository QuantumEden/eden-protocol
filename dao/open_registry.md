# DAO Open Registry – Eden Protocol

This document defines the symbolic entry mechanism for DAO membership under Eden Protocol.  
It enforces **truth-based access**, not economic privilege.

---

## Entry Requirements

To enter the DAO, a user must:

- Reach **Level 7+** (MeritCoin threshold)
- Complete at least **one Hero Quest**
- Have a **verified sacred path**
- Submit a **soulbound XP commit** to the ledger
- Accept the **sacred governance oath** (see below)

No wallet.  
No stake.  
Only symbolic integrity.

---

## DAO Onboarding Flow

1. **Complete Tree Growth**  
   - No trait under 50  
   - Lockout must be resolved

2. **XP Threshold Passed**  
   - Must reach next-level commit gate  
   - Lock state = False

3. **Oath of Alignment**  
   Upon entry, users must acknowledge:

   > “I serve not my will, but the truth I’ve revealed.
   > I hold no vote I have not earned.
   > I do not act for status, but for sovereignty.”

4. **MeritCoin Identity Sync**  
   - Merit commit is hashed and posted  
   - DAO key bound to soulform metadata

5. **DAO Profile Created**  
   - Includes: Archetype, Path, Level, Glyph, Soulform  
   - Visible only to approved registry auditors

## Voice Weight Calculation

DAO voting power is based on:

- **Level** (logarithmic)
- **Soulform Stage** (1–3)
- **Proposal Integrity History**
- **Recent XP decay / growth curve**

Votes are cast with **truth-weighting**, not token-weighting.

---

## Proposal Rights

Only users with:

- Level 9+  
- No active lockout  
- At least 1 co-authored passed proposal  

…may submit solo proposals.

All others must co-sign with a verified user.

---

## Removal Conditions

Users are temporarily ejected if:

- Their XP falls below Level 5
- Tree trait average drops below 45
- They fail a shadow quest (and refuse realignment)

Users may rejoin after completing a **DAO realignment trial**.

---

## Symbolic Integrity Enforcement

DAO membership is not permanent.
It is maintained by alignment, reflection, and truth.

Every vote is a ritual.
Every proposal is a mirror.
Every MeritCoin is a memory.
