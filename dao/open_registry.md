# 🗳️ DAO Open Registry – Eden Protocol

This document defines the symbolic mechanism for entry, participation, and integrity maintenance within the **Eden DAO** — the decentralized oracle of truth inside the Eden Protocol.

There is **no token stake**.  
There is **no fiat entry**.  
Access is earned only through **verified symbolic growth**.

---

## ✅ Entry Criteria

To unlock DAO voice and registry presence, a user must:

- Reach **Merit Level 7+**
- Complete at least **1 Hero Quest**
- Hold a verified **Sacred Path**
- Log a **soulbound XP commit**
- Accept the **Oath of Alignment**

Only truth grants voice.  
Only transformation permits governance.

## 🧬 DAO Onboarding Flow

### 1. 🌳 Tree Threshold Met
- No individual trait under `50`
- No active XP lockout
- Tree integrity confirmed

### 2. 🪙 Merit Threshold Met
- User must log verified level-up
- Current XP must exceed threshold
- Lock state must be `false`

### 3. 📜 Oath of Alignment
Upon successful growth, the user must affirm:

> “I serve not my will, but the truth I’ve revealed.  
> I hold no vote I have not earned.  
> I do not act for status, but for sovereignty.”

This is soulbound — not reversible.

### 4. 🧾 DAO Profile Creation
- Fields:
  - `user_id`
  - `archetype`
  - `merit_level`
  - `soulform`
  - `sacred_path`
  - `glyph`
- DAO profile is **only visible to trusted auditors**

### 5. 🔐 Registry Sync
- DAO key is derived from XP + soulform metadata
- Commit hash is stored on-chain (ZK-compatible)
- Voter signature reflects weighted alignment

## ⚖️ Voice Weighting Algorithm

DAO votes are not 1:1.  
They are **truth-weighted**.

| Factor | Influence |
|--------|-----------|
| `merit_level` | Logarithmic growth (e.g. 7 = 1x, 10 = 2x, 15 = 3x) |
| `soulform_stage` | (Seedling → Initiate → Ascendant) |
| `proposal integrity` | Vote history consistency, DAO ethic adherence |
| `recent growth curve` | XP and Tree trait delta (last 30 days) |

> The stronger your transformation, the clearer your voice.

---

## 📝 Proposal Rights

To submit a **solo proposal**, you must:

- Be Level **9+**
- Have **no lockouts**
- Co-author at least **1 passed proposal**

All others may **co-sign** existing proposals with a verified member.

Proposal status is tied to **XP decay** — inactivity diminishes voice over time.

---

## ⛔ Removal Triggers

You may be temporarily removed from the DAO registry if:

- XP level falls below `5`
- Tree trait average drops below `45`
- A Shadow Quest is failed and no realignment occurs

Re-entry is always possible — via a **DAO Realignment Trial**.

This includes:
- Shadow mission success
- Re-growth of Tree traits
- Recitation of the Oath again

## 🔐 Symbolic Integrity Enforcement

DAO voice is not a title.  
It is a ritual.

DAO proposals are not documents.  
They are mirrors.

DAO identity is not fixed.  
It is the echo of your evolution.

---

> You do not join Eden’s DAO.  
> You **become it** — or you do not.

All participation is voluntary.  
All truth is earned.
All memory is sacred.
