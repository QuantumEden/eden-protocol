# 🗳️ DAO Open Registry – Eden Protocol

This document defines the symbolic mechanism for entry, participation, and integrity maintenance within the **Eden DAO** — the decentralized oracle of truth inside the Eden Protocol.

There is **no token stake**.  
There is **no fiat entry**.  
Access is earned only through **verified symbolic growth**.

---

## ✅ Entry Criteria

To unlock DAO voice and registry presence, a user must:

- Reach **Merit Level 7+**
- Complete at least **1 Hero Quest**
- Hold a verified **Sacred Path**
- Log a **soulbound XP commit** (zkXP)
- Accept the **Oath of Alignment**

Only truth grants voice.  
Only transformation permits governance.

## 🧬 DAO Onboarding Flow

### 1. 🌳 Tree Threshold Met
- No individual trait under `50`
- No active XP lockout
- Tree integrity confirmed

### 2. 🪙 Merit Threshold Met
- User must log verified level-up
- Current XP must exceed threshold
- Lock state must be `false`

### 3. 📜 Oath of Alignment
Upon successful growth, the user must affirm:

> “I serve not my will, but the truth I’ve revealed.  
> I hold no vote I have not earned.  
> I do not act for status, but for sovereignty.”

This oath is soulbound and irreversible.

### 4. 🧾 DAO Profile Creation
Fields included:
- `user_id`
- `archetype`
- `merit_level`
- `soulform`
- `sacred_path`
- `glyph`
- `zkxp_commit_hash`

DAO profiles are **only visible to trusted auditors** or verified governance engines.

### 5. 🔐 Registry Sync
- DAO key derived from XP + soulform metadata
- zkXP commit hash bound to Tree metadata
- Voter signature reflects ritual status and alignment

## ⚖️ Voice Weighting Algorithm

DAO votes are not 1:1.  
They are **truth-weighted**.

| Factor               | Influence                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `merit_level`        | Logarithmic growth (e.g. 7 = 1x, 10 = 2x, 15 = 3x)     |
| `soulform_stage`     | (Seedling → Initiate → Ascendant)                     |
| `proposal integrity` | Vote history consistency, DAO ethic adherence          |
| `recent growth curve`| XP and Tree trait delta over trailing 30 days          |
| `ritual_verified`    | Whether soulform rituals were honored before voting   |

> The stronger your transformation, the clearer your voice.

## 📝 Proposal Rights

To submit a **solo proposal**, a member must:

- Be Level **9+**
- Have **no active lockouts**
- Co-author at least **1 passed proposal**
- Pass a symbolic **proposal alignment check**

Others may **co-sign** proposals as part of a verified ritual quorum.

Proposal status is tied to **XP decay** — prolonged dormancy weakens eligibility.

---

## ⛔ Removal Triggers

DAO registry presence may be suspended or revoked if:

- XP level falls below `5`
- Tree trait average drops under `45`
- A Shadow Quest is failed without realignment
- Multiple violations of the DAO Code of Conduct occur

Re-entry is possible through a **DAO Realignment Trial**, requiring:

- Successful shadow mission
- Regrowth of Tree attributes
- Recitation of the Oath of Alignment

Bans are rare but **ritually enforced**. Only tribunal consensus may initiate one.

## 🔐 Symbolic Integrity Enforcement

DAO voice is not a title.  
It is a ritual.

DAO proposals are not documents.  
They are mirrors.

DAO identity is not fixed.  
It is the echo of your evolution.

---

> You do not join Eden’s DAO.  
> You **become it** — or you do not.

All participation is voluntary.  
All truth is earned.  
All memory is sacred.
