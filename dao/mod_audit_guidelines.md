# 🛡️ DAO Mod Audit Guidelines

> This document defines the symbolic and procedural rules for community-suggested content, code, or ritual modifications within Eden Protocol. All proposals are subject to DAO oversight, zkXP alignment, and sacred path compliance.

---

## 🔄 Purpose

Eden’s modular architecture allows contributors to:

- Propose new quests and shadow trials
- Modify Tree trait growth or decay logic
- Suggest visual themes, rituals, or auras
- Expand sacred path interpretations
- Adjust XP thresholds, reward curves, or transformation gates

These changes are **sacred**. Every mod influences symbolic truth and the inner mythic arc — and must be handled with reverence and ritual precision.

---

## ✅ Eligibility to Submit

- Users must have:
  - Level 3+ **MeritCoin**
  - At least 1 completed **Shadow Quest**
  - A verified **zkXP commit hash**
  - A **Truth Integrity** score above the dynamic threshold

- Proposals must:
  - Be submitted via the DAO `/proposal_submitter.py` interface
  - Be reviewed through sacred path filters
  - Include complete documentation:
    - Schema or mechanic references
    - Narrative rationale
    - Symbolic impact

---

## 📜 Proposal Format

Each mod proposal must include the following fields:

- `mod_type` – *(e.g., "quest", "trait_decay", "ritual", "interface", "aura")*
- `title` – Symbolic name *(e.g., "Trial of the Ashen Path")*
- `description` – Purpose, metaphor, and intended transformation
- `alignment_check` – Supported or conflicting sacred paths
- `quest_logic` – Stub, logic block, or narrative pointer
- `impact_zone` – Affected Tree traits, XP schema, or UI interface

---

## 🧪 Audit Criteria

Mod proposals are reviewed on:

| Criterion              | Description                                                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Symbolic Integrity** | Does the proposal uphold Eden's mythos of transformation?                   |
| **Sacred Compliance**  | Does it respect and reinforce valid sacred paths?                           |
| **Non-Exploitability** | Can it be exploited to bypass XP, Shadow Quests, or ritual requirements?    |
| **Ritual Cohesion**    | Does it preserve the balance between presence and performance?              |
| **Narrative Clarity**  | Does it read clearly as part of Eden’s symbolic evolution?                  |

---

## ❌ Auto-Reject Conditions

Proposals will be immediately rejected if they:

- Reference blacklisted or forbidden sacred paths
- Promote gamification over transformation
- Contain trivial, ironic, or non-serious framing
- Bypass or undermine XP decay, soulform gates, or quest thresholds

---

## 🗳️ DAO Approval Process

1. Submit proposal via `/dao/proposal_submitter.py`
2. Format checked via symbolic lint validator
3. Three-stage review:
   - Community committee *(read-only feedback)*
   - Sacred path audit *(auto-filter by mythic alignment)*
   - Truth Integrity Validator *(XP + shadow history + soulform check)*
4. Ritual-verified zkXP vote initiated
5. If passed → sent to `/mod_loader.py` and appended to `/docs/ritual_quest_examples.md`

---

## 🔮 Long-Term Roadmap

Upcoming features for symbolic mod governance:

- Symbolic merit-based mod rating (no stars, only glyphs)
- Sacred path endorsement system (publicly auditable)
- zkXP Contributor ledger trail
- DAO-authorized seasonal **Ritual Patch** cycles
- `soulform-mod-lock` gating system for high-impact changes
