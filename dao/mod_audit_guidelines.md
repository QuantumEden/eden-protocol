# 🗳️ Eden Protocol – Mod Audit Guidelines

> “Eden is a myth, not a modpack. You do not build into Eden. You align with it.”

This document outlines the DAO’s policy for reviewing, approving, and moderating community-created symbolic content — including mods, rituals, glyph sets, quests, voice libraries, and sacred expansions.

Mods are welcome. Chaos is not. Eden is a symbolic operating system — not a playground for ego projection or ideological warfare.

---

## 🔐 Sacred Content Governance

### ✅ All mods must:
- Respect the Eden Canon and Sacred Path Whitelist  
- Use only symbolic, mythic, or therapeutic imagery  
- Avoid any parody, satire, or defilement of sacred themes  
- Pass a DAO vote if they include:
  - Custom archetypes
  - Original quests using religious or metaphysical frameworks
  - Sacred path-specific glyphs, voice files, or visuals

---

## 🛑 Prohibited Mod Content

Mods will be automatically rejected if they:

- Use any banned spiritual or ideological symbolism (see `/schemas/sacred_path_whitelist.json`)
- Include rainbow iconography or symbols repurposed from real-world activist movements
- Depict inverted, chaotic, or trauma-glorifying entities (e.g., deities of cruelty, blood magic, sexual violation, etc.)
- Assign XP for confrontation, trolling, or performance-based dominance
- Bypass ZK privacy mechanics by exposing or indexing identity traits

## 🧩 Mod Categories Requiring DAO Review

| Category | Example | Requires DAO Vote? |
|----------|---------|--------------------|

| ✅ Sacred Path Content | Kabbalah questline, Norse animism tree | Yes |
| ✅ Visuals & Glyphs | New aura sets, conviction glyphs | Yes |
| ✅ Sound & Voice Packs | Mentor or Inner Voice variants | Yes |

---

## 🛠️ Submission Requirements

All mods must be submitted with:

- A symbolic intent statement
- Declaration of sacred path alignment (if applicable)
- Sample payload result (e.g. XP impact, voice logic, aura effect)
- Affirmation of ZK compliance (no personal data storage)

Mods that touch sacred themes must undergo an additional symbolic ethics audit from a DAO guardian or elder.

---

## 🔄 DAO Review Protocol

1. **Submission Queue** → `/mods/` with tagging system
2. **Community Audit** → Early feedback via merit-based contributors
3. **DAO Vote** → Verified users only
4. **Sacred Content Review** → Only triggered if flagged by guardian or mod includes sacred_path hooks
5. **Approval or Rejection** → Immutable result with rationale posted to `/logs/mod_decisions/`

---

## 📜 Permanent Bans & Blacklist Enforcement

Mods that attempt to:

- Subvert sacred glyphs
- Trivialize trauma
- Break multiplayer ritual harmony
- Force opt-in mechanics
- Mimic real-world social credit or advertising systems

...will be permanently blacklisted, and their creators may be suspended from DAO participation based on Truth Integrity regression.
