# 🗳️ Eden Protocol – Mod Proposal Audit Guidelines

> This document defines the DAO rules for evaluating proposed modifications to symbolic content, quests, archetypes, or ritual systems in EdenQuest.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

The Eden DAO does not legislate efficiency.  
It stewards **meaning**.

Every proposal must be symbolically coherent, psychospiritually safe, and aligned with Eden’s core covenant:
> “Transformation must be sacred, voluntary, and soulbound.”

---

## ✅ What Can Be Proposed

- 🌀 New Realignment Quests
- 🧬 Additional Sacred Paths (must meet whitelist policy)
- 🛡️ Rituals or symbolic boss encounters
- 🧠 Custom archetypes (requires mythic coherence)
- 📜 Mythic Dungeon expansions
- 🔮 Narrative Voice updates (e.g. new Inner Voice personas)

---

## ❌ What Cannot Be Proposed

- Gamified monetization (e.g. paid XP boosts, cosmetics)
- Non-trauma-informed content (coercive, triggering, or violent language)
- Banned sacred paths (see `/schemas/sacred_path_whitelist.json`)
- Personal data exposure or surveillance-based quests
- Leaderboards or performance rankings

---

## 🧾 Required Metadata

All proposals must include:

| Field | Required |
|-------|----------|
| `title` | ✅ |
| `symbolic_justification` | ✅ |
| `xp_threshold` | ✅ |
| `truth_commit_hash` | ✅ |
| `sacred_path_alignment` | ✅ |
| `archetype_impact` | ✅ |
| `ritual_test_case` | Optional |
| `ZK validation` | ✅ if user-based |

---

## 🧠 Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be reviewed based on:

- **Mythic Coherence** – Is it symbolically consistent?
- **Therapeutic Integrity** – Is it safe for trauma-informed play?
- **Sacred Path Alignment** – Does it contradict any path already canonized?
- **Truth Integrity Score** – Was the proposer acting in alignment with their journey?

---

## 🧩 Voting Requirements

| Proposal Type | Required XP | Truth Integrity |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Minor (ritual only) | 200 | 60% |
| Major (new path or archetype) | 500 | 80% |
| System-Level Update | 1000 | 95% soulbound verified |

All proposals are **soulbound** — no delegation, no purchase, no proxy.

---

## 🕊️ Ethics Review Clause

The DAO may elect a 3-member ethics circle to privately review and debate any proposal that:
- Alters sacred path rules
- References active sociopolitical trauma
- Involves potential abuse vectors

Their review is final unless vetoed by a 95% symbolic quorum.

> “The DAO is not a legislature. It is a mirror. And mirrors do not lie — they reflect what stands before them.”
