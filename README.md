# üåø The Eden Protocol ‚Äì README

> A mythic-operating system engineered for behavioral transformation, therapeutic immersion, and cryptographic individuation. Built for veterans, seekers, and healers who refuse to be defined by their trauma.

## üß† What Is Eden Protocol?

Eden Protocol is a symbolic infrastructure stack blending:
- **AI-generated mythic quests** (CBT, DBT, Freudian, Jungian, Logotherapy)
- **Quantum-resistant blockchain** (Kyber + Dilithium)
- **Avatar-based psychometric identity system**
- **DAO-based merit governance**
- **Biometric & behavioral integration**

It is not a game. It is a sacred mirror.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

üß© Modular systems include:
- `/src/avatar_identity_engine/` ‚Äì MBTI/IQ/EQ ‚Üí symbolic avatar system
- `/src/tree_of_life/` ‚Äì Trait and growth model
- `/src/leveling_system/` ‚Äì XP decay, lockout, and merit evolution
- `/src/dao/` ‚Äì Truth-weighted voting and narrative proposals
- `/src/meritcoin/` ‚Äì Soulbound XP logic
- `/src/blockchain/` ‚Äì XP commit hash logic and zkStub
- `/docs/` ‚Äì Interface specs, UI plans, symbolic assets, hardware stack
- `/sim/` ‚Äì XP validation, avatar simulation, world state loops

---

## üåê Target Environments

- **Mobile (React Native)** ‚Äì Journaling, Tree of Life, DAO access
- **Web Dashboard (Streamlit/React.js)** ‚Äì XP tracking, proposal creation, real-time world metrics
- **VR/XR (UE5)** ‚Äì Closed-world symbolic dungeons, aura visualization, NPC therapy quests

> MVP simulations run on Python + mocked APIs, with Unreal Engine 5 targeted for full XR deployment.

---

## üîê Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python (core), JSON Schema
- **Frontend Prototypes**: Streamlit, Figma, React Native
- **AI Engine**: GPT-4+ (symbolic quest logic)
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs (NPC & internal narration)
- **Blockchain**: CRYSTALS-Kyber + Dilithium (zk-stub ready)
- **Security**: Open Enclave SDK (offline psychometric validation)

## üïäÔ∏è License & Usage

The Eden Protocol is a sanctuary of code and meaning. All code is free to view, simulate, and contribute under **custom license for symbolic and therapeutic use only**.

> ‚ÄúWhen the world turns its back on you look within. Eden is a choice to be the person you have always dreamed you could become. Will you wallow in misery and self-pity, or will you rise above adversity to become the hero you were always meant to be.‚Äù
