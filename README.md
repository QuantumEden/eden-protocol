# The Eden Protocol

**QuantumEden’s Eden Protocol** is a quantum-resistant blockchain architecture designed to restore institutional trust, safeguard digital sovereignty, and empower veterans through civic merit and technological honor.

## Why Eden?

- **Quantum Threats:** Classical cryptography is vulnerable to quantum computing.
- **Institutional Trust:** Civic infrastructure is fragile, corrupted, and opaque.
- **Veteran Empowerment:** Provide meaningful purpose and restore trust through veteran-led initiatives.

## Key Components

- **MeritCoin Ledger**: Immutable ledger rewarding verified civic contribution.
- **Quantum-Resistant Blockchain (EdenChain)**: Built with NIST-standard CRYSTALS algorithms.
- **Air-Gapped Legacy Enclave (IBM 5100 Emulation)**: Offline approval system immune to AI and digital threats.

## Milestones (2025)

- [ ] Working blockchain testnet (Q2)
- [ ] Secure first grant/funding round (Q2-Q3)
- [ ] Form veteran-led LLC (QuantumEden Holdings) (Q3)
- [ ] Launch full public beta (Q4)

## Join the Mission

We seek veterans, developers, cryptographers, and dreamers.
