# The Eden Protocol

**QuantumEden’s Eden Protocol** is a quantum-resistant blockchain designed to restore institutional trust, safeguard digital sovereignty, and empower veterans through civic merit and technological honor.

## Why Eden?

- **Quantum Threats:** Classical cryptography will fail against emerging quantum computing threats.
- **Institutional Trust:** Civic infrastructure is vulnerable, opaque, and outdated.
- **Veteran Empowerment:** Provides purpose, meaningful engagement, and technical careers for veterans.

## Core Architecture

- **MeritCoin Ledger:** Immutable blockchain ledger rewarding civic contributions and verified achievements.
- **Quantum-Resistant Blockchain (EdenChain):** Built on NIST-standard CRYSTALS-Kyber encryption and CRYSTALS-Dilithium digital signatures for post-quantum security.
- **QuantumEden Secure Enclave:** Air-gapped hardware and software environment acting as a cryptographic approval vault, ensuring offline verification immune to external cyber threats.

## Roadmap (2025)

- [ ] Deploy working EdenChain blockchain testnet (Q2)
- [ ] Secure initial funding/grants (Q2–Q3)
- [ ] Establish veteran-owned LLC—QuantumEden Holdings (Q3)
- [ ] Launch fully operational beta network (Q4)

## Join the Mission

We invite veterans, cybersecurity professionals, blockchain developers, and visionaries to collaborate.

> "Society is a garden of trust, where the tree of life withers or grows.  
> The American Dream is a vision of new Eden. An impossible hope of a world better than our own actualized one encryption at a time. Welcome to QuantumEden."
