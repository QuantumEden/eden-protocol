# The Eden Protocol

**QuantumEden’s Eden Protocol** is a modular, quantum-secure infrastructure designed to replace legacy therapeutic, bureaucratic, and economic systems with a blockchain-backed meritocracy rooted in behavioral integrity, psychological individuation, and AI-enhanced healing.

It is the living ledger of **QuantumEden Holdings** and the soul of **The Eden Institute**. It reflects real-world transformation—tracking personal growth through the Tree of Life and recording collective truth through the World Tree.

## Why Eden?

- **Veterans were abandoned. Civilians are adrift. Institutions have collapsed.**
- Eden replaces broken systems with symbolic progression, AI therapy, and cryptographic proof-of-growth.
- This protocol rewards real healing, verified transformation, and civic contribution—not performance, status, or wealth.

## Core Infrastructure

### 1. **EdenChain (Core Blockchain)**
- Post-quantum cryptography (CRYSTALS-Kyber, Dilithium)
- Immutable ledger for quests, XP, progress, and DAO activity

### 2. **MeritCoin (XP & Decay System)**
- Soulbound XP token earned through truth and contribution
- Decays with neglect, restored by action or guided healing
- Powers progression and DAO vote weight

### 3. **Avatar Identity Engine**
- Avatar created from six psychometric batteries (MBTI, Raven’s, MSCEIT, DAT, RIASEC, MFQ)
- Determines class, aura, skill unlocks, moral alignment
- Avatar evolves based on actual behavior and therapeutic quests

### 4. **Tree of Life (Personal Growth Tracker)**
- Visual, symbolic representation of real-world wellness and life skills
- Tracks balance, growth, stagnation, or decay in user behavior

### 5. **World Tree (DAO Ledger & Collective State)**
- Aggregates all user progress to represent global merit
- DAO governance, funding, and alignment are derived from this ledger
- Becomes a live socioeconomic oracle: Eden’s economic body

### 6. **EdenQuest Engine (AI-Guided Therapy)**
- GPT-powered quests built from user confession, trauma, and transformation goals
- CBT, DBT, logotherapy, symbolic exposure therapy
- Dungeon-like virtual experiences that generate MeritCoin and level-ups

### 7. **Secure Enclave (Operational Security Layer)**
- Offline module for cryptographic key generation, identity signing, and sensitive intake protection
- All mission-critical secrets handled outside the public repo

### 8. **AI Integration Layer**
- Powers quest logic, avatar insight, symbolic consistency, and community dynamics
- Protects against manipulation and ensures mythic integrity

## Eden Governance Structure

- **QuantumEden Holdings** – IP and infrastructure trust
- **The Eden Institute** – Executive council and ethics board
- **The Quantum Foundation (DAO)** – Weighted by MeritCoin, governs funding and alignment
- **Eden Protocol** – Implements and enforces the will of the DAO and Institute

> "The more people heal through Eden, the stronger the ledger becomes. 
> The stronger the ledger becomes, the more unshakable the world that follows."
