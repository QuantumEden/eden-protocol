# 🖼️ EdenQuest UI Mock Screens – Overview

This folder is a symbolic UI staging ground. It contains reference layouts, interface breakdowns, and design guidance for building the EdenQuest experience across mobile, desktop, and XR platforms.

---

## 🔧 Purpose

- To visualize how users **interact with their inner world** symbolically
- To align screen designs with the outputs of `/schemas/*.json`, `/src/`, and `/sim/`
- To create a design language where every interface reflects a **mythic psychological state**

## 🧩 Contribution Notes

- All mockups must reflect **symbolic UX** — not efficiency-first gamification
- Use aura cues, glyph iconography, and subtle animations to reflect state
- Do not overdesign — Eden is sacred space, not app clutter
