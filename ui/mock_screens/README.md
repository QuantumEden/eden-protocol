# 🖼️ EdenQuest UI Mock Screens – Design Blueprint

> This folder will contain future wireframes, Figma exports, or concept sketches for all Eden user interfaces. Even without visuals, this document serves as a symbolic bridge between backend truth and frontend expression.

## 🧪 DESIGN NOTES

- **No point scores. No avatars with stats.**  
  Symbolism is the UX.

- **Every screen should feel like a ritual**, not a task.

- **Use color theory sparingly** – sacred paths determine hue shifts:
  - Hermeticism = Indigo / Gold
  - Buddhism = Saffron / White
  - Animism = Earth / Green / Mist

- All haptic feedback should feel **ceremonial**, not arcade.

> Until they manifest, let this space be the altar.
